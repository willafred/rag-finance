    By Jonathan  Guilford
       NEW YORK, Feb 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General
Motors <GM.N> powered through bruising strikes, rampant supply
shortages and a distressing spike in interest rates to generate
three times as much cash and become the second-biggest U.S.
seller of electric vehicles, behind Tesla <TSLA.O>. To ease the
sting of the latest gloomy signs, boss Mary Barra is turning
back to the same section in her manual: return capital to
shareholders.
Nearly two years ago, after the United Auto Workers went on
strike and GM’s costly EV transition sputtered, Barra unveiled a
plan to buy back $10 billion of stock and sweetened the
dividend. In 2024, the Chevrolet and Cadillac manufacturer
trimmed its promised battery-powered production levels and then
set up a new $6 billion repurchase plan. GM now says it intends
to buy yet another $6 billion slug of shares and is lifting the
dividend 25%, to 15 cents.
Based on Tuesday’s closing price, the first $2 billion outlay,
set to happen immediately, should retire 4% of GM’s available
equity, lifting earnings per share and in turn the stock price.
The decision reflects the company’s ability to chug along even
as rival Ford Motor <F.N> occasionally misfired. Cash flow from
GM’s automotive operations, less capital expenditures, more than
tripled between 2018 and 2024.
    At just 4 times expected earnings over the next 12 months,
though, the shares are trading below the 5 times to 6 times they
garnered before the pandemic, per LSEG. New potholes always
spring up. Chief among them now is President Donald Trump’s
threatened 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Only 63% of GM’s
North American vehicle assembly occurs at home, the lowest of
the Motor City trio, analysts at Jefferies reckon. Barra
guesstimates that about half of trade levies can be offset. The
optimistic take is that they may not be implemented anyway.
Vehicle buyers are also increasingly failing to pay back loans
promptly. The share of borrowers late by 30 days or more has
grown past pre-Covid-19 norms, based on data from the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. The silver lining is that, at less
than 2% for the in-house automotive finance operations, stress
levels are running lower than at large banks and other
specialized lenders.
    Curbs to EV subsidies also could hurt GM, however. Barra’s
latest buyback has no expiration date and it also can be
adjusted, but the company is nevertheless sending cash to
shareholders just as costs threaten to rise. It’s a celebration
of the good times before they roll to a stop.

    General Motors said on February 26 that it had authorized a
new $6 billion share repurchase program, a third of which is
intended to be spent immediately. The program has no expiration
date.
    The Detroit-based automaker said it also would increase its
quarterly dividend to 15 cents a share from 12 cents a share.

      Acquisition includes 300 staff, excludes around 100 jobs

      Deal subject to merger control law, terms undisclosed
    

  
       BERLIN, Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. carmaker Tesla <TSLA.O>
will acquire parts of the insolvent German high-tech parts maker
Manz AG <M5ZG.DE>, including more than 300 employees at its site
in Reutlingen city in the southwest, the German company said on
Tuesday. 
    The deal marks a wider presence by Tesla in Germany, where
it runs a manufacturing site near Berlin, even after CEO Elon
Musk endorsed the far-right party AfD, which mainstream parties
have refused to work with due to its extreme positions.
     Tesla sold almost 60% fewer cars in Germany in January than
a year earlier, as the U.S. electric vehicle maker faces a test
of popularity amid Musk's U.S. political involvement.
    Manz's insolvency administrator and Tesla Automation GmbH, a
subsidiary of the U.S. company, signed a purchase agreement on
Monday, the German company said.
    The parties agreed not to disclose a purchase price, and
completion of the transaction is subject to merger control law.
    Tesla Automation, which specializes in the construction of
special-purpose machines at three German locations, plans to
take over more than 300 employees, acquire movable tangible
assets, and use Manz's property in Reutlingen.
    Approximately 100 employees will lose their jobs and not be
transferred to Tesla Automation, according to Manz.
    Insolvency administrator Martin Mucha said the structured
sales process for other assets was moving forward.
    ""We are currently holding promising talks with several
interested parties,"" added Mucha in a statement.

       HONG KONG, Feb 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - At least
Makoto Uchida knows his turnaround plan for Nissan Motor
<7201.T> is worth something. The beleaguered $11 billion
Japanese carmaker’s CEO now has KKR <KKR.N> mulling an
investment, Bloomberg reported on the same day he officially
broke off merger talks with Honda <7267.T>. Foxconn <2317.TW> is
interested, as still, is Honda – if Uchida leaves, according to
the Financial Times. And now some Japanese bigwigs may want
Tesla <TSLA.O> to buy a stake, the FT reported on Friday.
There’s a clear prize: a successful overhaul could almost triple
Nissan’s valuation, Breakingviews calculates. Trouble is, it’s a
daunting risk-reward trade.
    Nissan's automotive unit has been leaking red ink, with a
roughly $1 billion operating loss in the first nine months of
this financial year. Shareholders appear to ascribe it a
negative value: the company's lending division alone is probably
worth some $12 billion, based on the average of 80% of book
value Japanese financial companies trade at, per Fitch.
    Assume Uchida hits his goal of boosting the carmaking arm's
operating margin to 4% for its March 2027 financial year. Using
estimates gathered by Visible Alpha of $77 billion in annual
revenue from selling 3.1 million vehicles, that'd bring in $3
billion. Lop off interest payments and 25% tax, and net profit
would be $2 billion. Apply a multiple of just over 7 times
earnings, the average for a basket of Japanese peers, and the
manufacturing business would be worth $14 billion.
    Such an improvement ought to bolster the finance unit, too,
so value it at its estimated March 2027 book value of almost $16
billion, per Visible Alpha. The combined entity could then
command a price tag of around $30 billion.
    Getting there from here is a tall order. It would require
proving that annual car sales will stabilise at around 3
million, having fallen to 3.4 million last year from almost 6
million in 2018. Uchida would also have to ensure that drivers
will on average pay 8% more for their Nissan than they do now.
The company has also been leaning on incentives to encourage
purchases.
    And he needs his plans to close factories and slash
headcount to both succeed and not be undone by rising costs
elsewhere. That could be hard: recent history shows Nissan's
expenses are sticky, and the company has to boost investment in
hybrid and electric vehicles. 
    External forces could make those requirements even harder.
If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's import tariffs
would hurt Nissan in its largest market; in its second-largest,
China, it and other foreign brands are losing share to local
rivals like BYD <002594.SZ> <1211.HK>.
    The prospect of finding synergies may give some potential
suitors more stomach for these risks than others: Honda has its
own auto unit, while KKR owns parts-maker Marelli, which counts
Nissan as a major customer. Whoever gets involved, though,
Uchida's company is in for a white-knuckle ride.

 (Adds background on Tesla capacity, deliveries in paragraphs
5-6, analyst comment about US tariffs in paragraphs 15-16,

       Feb 21 (Reuters) - A high-level Japanese group that
includes a former prime minister has drawn up plans for Tesla
<TSLA.O> to invest in Nissan <7201.T> after the collapse of its
merger talks with Honda <7267.T>, the Financial Times said on
Friday.
    A separate Nikkei newspaper report said Taiwan's Foxconn
<2317.TW> has proposed forming a partnership with Honda with an
ultimate aim of creating a four-way framework that would also
include Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors <7211.T>.
    The Japanese group behind the plans for Tesla to invest in
Nissan hopes the Elon Musk-led company will become a strategic
investor, believing it is keen to acquire Nissan's plants in the
United States, according to the Financial Times.
    The proposal is being led by former Tesla board member
Hiromichi Mizuno with support from ex-premier Yoshihide Suga and
his former aide Hiroto Izumi, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified sources.
    Some analysts, however, are doubtful of Tesla's interest in
acquiring U.S. plants, citing its ample capacity at existing
factories and first decline in yearly deliveries in 2024.
        Tesla said last month it expected the vehicle business
to 
    return to growth
     this year.
  
    Suga's office said it was not aware of a plan to encourage
Tesla to invest in Nissan. Suga stood down as prime minister in
2021 but remains a member of Japan's lower house, representing a
constituency in Nissan's home prefecture of Kanagawa.
    In a social media post, Mizuno said he had ""absolutely no
involvement"" in what was reported in the FT article, adding that
he doubted if Tesla had any interest at all in Nissan factories
given Tesla's unique factory design.
    Nissan declined to comment on the report, while Tesla did
not respond to requests for comment. Reuters was not immediately
able to contact Izumi.
        Matt Britzman, a senior equity analyst at Hargreaves
Lansdown, said there was no value for Tesla in investing in
infrastructure from a legacy carmaker.
    ""Tesla's secret weapon is the novel way its factories have
been designed and optimised for its cars,"" Britzman said.
    Nissan shares closed up 9.6% after the FT report. The
automaker and Honda ended talks to forge a $60-billion car
company last week. Nissan said it will seek new partnerships. 
    According to the FT, some Nissan board members have
suggested Tesla and Apple <AAPL.O> as ideal strategic investors.
    Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
    Acquiring Nissan's U.S. plants might make sense considering
President Donald Trump's plans to apply new tariffs on auto
imports, and separate tariffs on Mexico and Canada, said
Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein.
        ""The cost to build a new auto plant is high, so if Tesla
is able to acquire an existing plant that greatly reduces the
cost,"" he said.
  
    Tesla ended 2024 with $36.56 billion in cash and
equivalents, giving it a large war chest for any deal, although
it has shown little appetite for investing in auto companies.
    Sources have previously told Reuters that Nissan was open to
working with new partners, with the world's largest contract
electronics manufacturer Foxconn seen as one candidate.
    Later on Friday, the Nikkei newspaper reported that through
partnering with Honda, Foxconn aimed to form a broader framework
for cooperation to compete against Tesla and Chinese EV makers.
    Honda declined to comment on the Nikkei report. Foxconn
representatives did not immediately reply to a comment request.
    Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida said last week that Nissan and
Foxconn had not held talks at management level. A day before
Uchida made his remarks, the Taiwanese firm's chairman had said
it would consider taking a stake in Nissan for cooperation.

       Feb 19 (Reuters) - Nikola <NKLA.O> said on Wednesday it
had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and would pursue
a sale of its assets, the latest electric-vehicle maker to
stumble after grappling with tepid demand, rapid cash burn and
funding challenges.
    The development ends a challenging journey, which included
several leadership changes, plummeting share values and
short-seller allegations.
    EV startups that went public during the pandemic, promising
to revolutionize the sector, such as Fisker, Proterra and
Lordstown Motors have filed for bankruptcy in recent years as
funding for their capital-intensive operations dried up due to
high interest rates and flagging demand.
    ""Like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we
have faced various market and macroeconomic factors that have
impacted our ability to operate,"" Nikola CEO Steve Girsky said
in a statement.
    ""Unfortunately, our very best efforts have not been enough
to overcome these significant challenges,"" he added.
    Elon Musk-led EV pioneer Tesla <TSLA.O> reported its first
drop in annual sales in 2024 as high borrowing costs and an
aging lineup crimped demand, despite offers and incentives.    
    Nikola, which started out making battery-powered semi-trucks
and pivoted to electric trucks that use hydrogen, said it
decided to initiate a sale process to maximize value and ensure
an orderly wind down.
    The firm will continue some support operations for trucks in
the field and some hydrogen-fueling operations through the end
of March.
    Phoenix, Arizona-based Nikola, delivered its first vehicle
in December 2021. A series of fire incidents involving its
electric trucks in 2023 resulted in a recall of all its vehicles
and raised safety concerns.
    Nikola ramped up production of its hydrogen-powered trucks
in 2024, but still lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on
every vehicle sold as fleet operators were reluctant to invest
in electric truck adoption amid high borrowing costs.
    The stock fell about 38% on Wednesday, valuing the company
at less than $50 million. A sharp plunge from a peak market
capitalization of about $27 billion in 2020, when it was valued
more than Ford Motor <F.N>.
    ""Just the struggles that they have faced, plus the
increasing competition, operational challenges, and high cost
for the EV industry as a whole. I think all of that came
together,"" said Sarah Foss, head of legal at credit and
restructuring analysis firm Debtwire.
    
    STRUGGLING FINANCES
    The company, which has said its Coolidge, Arizona,
manufacturing facility can produce about 2,400 trucks per year
across three shifts, listed assets of between $500 million and
$1 billion. It estimated its liabilities were between $1 billion
and $10 billion, according to a filing with the U.S. bankruptcy
court for the district of Delaware.
    Nikola's cash and cash equivalents dropped sharply to $198.3
million at the end of September, compared with $464.7 million at
the end of 2023. On Wednesday, the company said it was entering
Chapter 11 proceedings with $47 million in cash on hand.
    The stock has fallen below the $1-mark several times and the
company resorted to a reverse stock split last year to comply
with Nasdaq's listing rules.
    Shortly after the company went public in 2020 through a
merger with a blank-check company, it was hit by a scathing
report by short-seller Hindenburg, which disbanded earlier this
year. Nikola had denied the allegations.
    Founder and then CEO Trevor Milton was convicted of fraud in
2022 and sentenced to four years in prison the following year.

    Nikola filed for 
    bankruptcy protection
     on Wednesday, the latest electric vehicle firm to shut
operations after grappling with tepid demand, rapid cash burn
and funding challenges.
  
        The move ends a challenging journey for the electric
truck maker which included several leadership changes, sinking
share value and short-seller allegations.   
  
        Here is a look at how EV startups have been faring in
the face of high interest rates and inflation, pushing them to
seek fresh capital to continue operations. 
  
        
  
        
    NIKOLA <NKLA.O> 
    Nikola is the latest EV maker to file for bankruptcy, after
a tumultuous journey in a highly competitive industry, wrought
with numerous vehicle issues and weak demand. 
        Nikola said it decided to initiate a sale process of its
assets to maximize value and ensure an orderly wind down.
  
        The firm will continue some operations for trucks in the
field and some hydrogen-fueling operations through the end of
March.
  
                
  
        FISKER  
  
        Fisker 
    filed for bankruptcy
     last year after experiencing weak demand for its Ocean SUVs
and facing competition from large players such as Tesla
<TSLA.O>.
    The collapse of its talks with an automaker - which Reuters
had reported to be Nissan <7201.T> - meant that it was denied
$350 million in funding from an unnamed investor that was
contingent on the automaker's investment and forced Fisker to
explore options.
    In its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in Delaware, Fisker's
operating unit, Fisker Group Inc, estimated assets of $500
million to $1 billion and liabilities of $100 million to $500
million.
        
  
        RIVIAN AUTOMOTIVE <RIVN.O> 
    Rivian is seen to be better placed than its rivals, thanks
in part to a joint venture with German automaker Volkswagen
Group <VOWG_p.DE>, which in November raised its funding amount
to $5.8 billion to develop electric vehicles and architecture. 
        
        LORDSTOWN MOTORS 
  
        Lordstown Motors 
    filed for bankruptcy protection
     in 2023 and put itself up for sale after failing to resolve
a dispute over a promised investment from Taiwan's Foxconn
<2354.TW>.
    In the complaint, Lordstown accused Foxconn of fraudulent
conduct and a series of broken promises in failing to abide by
an agreement to invest up to $170 million in the
electric-vehicle manufacturer.
            
  
        LUCID GROUP <LCID.O> 
    Lucid Group said in October it expects to raise $1.67
billion from a stock sale as it looks to ramp up production of
its new Gravity SUV. 
        The company is backed by Saudi Arabia's Public
Investment Fund, its largest shareholder, which also committed 
    $1.5 billion
     in cash in August last year.  
  
        
  
        CANOO
  
        Canoo said it 
    filed for bankruptcy
     under Chapter 7 last month, ceasing operations effective
immediately.
  
        The EV startup faced financial challenges and struggled
to raise additional funding from the U.S. Department of Energy's
Loan Programs Office amid uncertain demand for its
microbus-inspired cargo vans.
  
        
  
        PROTERRA
  
        Proterra filed for 
    Chapter 11 bankruptcy
     protection in 2023 due to slowing demand and financial

background throughout)
       Feb 19 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's X social media platform
is in talks to raise money from investors at a $44 billion
valuation, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing people
familiar with the matter.
    Musk bought X, formerly Twitter, for the same price in 2022,
but some investors including Fidelity Investments have sharply
written down the value of their stake as the platform struggled
to retain advertisers after the takeover.
         X did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The
reported talks come as valuations of Musk's other companies
soared after the victory of Donald Trump in the U.S.
presidential race. 
    Tesla shares have surged more than 40% since Trump's
victory, while SpaceX was valued at $350 billion in December.
Musk's AI startup, xAI, is also in talks to raise $10 billion at
a $75 billion valuation, up from $40 billion, according to
reports.
        Musk's close ties with Trump and return of some
advertisers to X have lifted expectations of better finances at
the platform. That has helped banks offload the debt they issued
to support Musk's Twitter buyout, a source told Reuters earlier
this month.
    Banks, led by Morgan Stanley, sold another chunky portion of
loans that formed the $13 billion debt supporting Musk's
acquisition, as the deal found broad interest from large fund
managers attracted by the prospect of improving revenue of X. 
    Talks for the new X financing round were still on and the
details could change, the Bloomberg News report said, adding
that this would be the first known investment round for the
social media company since Musk took it private.

       NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Hedge fund giant
Bridgewater Associates added shares of Tesla <TSLA.O> to its
portfolio in the fourth quarter, while it trimmed exposure to
the rest of the ""Magnificent Seven"" group of U.S. tech and
growth stocks, a regulatory filing showed. 
    The firm founded by investor Ray Dalio ended December with a
small stake in Elon Musk's electric carmaker, comprised of
153,589 shares and worth $62 million, according to the filing
late on Thursday.
    Shares of Tesla are down roughly 13% this year and down more
than 26% since their all-time closing high on December 17.
However, the stock remains up well over 30% since the November 5
presidential election, with the company seen as benefiting from
Musk's close association with President Donald Trump.
    The billionaire entrepreneur is heading the Department of
Government Efficiency, which is in charge of cutting waste from
federal agencies.
    Meanwhile, the macro hedge fund made sizeable cuts in the
rest of its Magnificent Seven stocks. It slashed its stake in
Apple <AAPL.O> by 40% to 617,203 shares, and reduced its
position in Amazon <AMZN.O> by almost 35%.
    Cuts in Nvidia <NVDA.O>, Microsoft <MSFT.O>, Meta <META.O>
and Alphabet <GOOGL.O> ranged between 17.3% and 26.4%. However,
those positions were still worth hundreds of millions of
dollars. 
    In a recent letter to investors, Bridgewater's co-chief
investment officer, Karen Karniol-Tambour, discussed the
concentration of investors in AI stocks, saying it ""creates
significant portfolio diversification challenges.""
    The fund positions were revealed in quarterly securities
filings known as 13Fs. While backward-looking, these snapshots
show what funds owned on the last day of the quarter and are one
of the few methods by which hedge funds and other institutional
investors declare their positions. The filings do not indicate
exact timing of purchases or sales and may not reflect current
holdings.
    The hedge fund did not immediately comment on the changes in
its portfolio.

 (Updates with new information and OpenAI filing)
    By Shivani Tanna, Aditya Soni and Krystal Hu
       Feb 13 (Reuters) - A consortium led by Elon Musk will
withdraw its $97.4-billion bid for OpenAI's non-profit arm if
the ChatGPT maker drops plans to become a for-profit entity, the
billionaire's lawyers said in a court filing on Wednesday. 
Musk has been trying to block the startup he co-founded and
later left from becoming a for-profit firm, a move OpenAI argues
is crucial for it to secure more capital and compete in the AI
race.
""If (the) OpenAI board is prepared to preserve the charity's
mission and stipulate to take the 'for-sale' sign off its assets
by halting its conversion, Musk will withdraw the bid,"" the
filing in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California,
said. 
    If not, ""the charity must be compensated by what an
arms-length buyer will pay for its assets."" 
Musk's ""serious offer"" was to further the charity's mission, the
filing added.    
    Musk owns a competing AI startup, xAI, launched in 2023.
    OpenAI and Musk, CEO of Tesla <TSLA.O> and social media
platform X, did not respond to requests for comment.
OpenAI's board has received the bid, after an initial snafu of
not seeing it 24 hours after Musk's group said they sent the bid
over, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
    Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said this week the non-profit
that controls the company was not for sale, calling the bid
""ridiculous.""
    The board plans to reject it because its non-profit is not
for sale, and the non-profit board's mission is to ensure AI
benefits humanity, the source added. 
OpenAI said in its own filing with the same court on Wednesday
that Musk’s bid to buy OpenAI contradicts the arguments he is
making in court that the startup's assets cannot be transferred
for private gain, calling it ""an improper bid to undermine a
competitor.""
Musk co-founded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 as a non-profit, but
left in 2018 before the company took off due to differences over
its direction and funding sources. Altman then became CEO of
OpenAI and launched a for-profit unit within the startup to
secure funding from investors such as Microsoft <MSFT.O>.
Altman is now working on a plan to restructure the core business
into a for-profit firm that will no longer be controlled by its
non-profit board. The non-profit will, however, continue to
exist and own a stake in the for-profit company. Musk has sued
to prevent this transition.
    Several analysts have said regardless of the outcome, the
bid could complicate OpenAI's efforts to turn into a for-profit
company as it may set a high floor value for the non-profit that
controls the startup. 
Questions have been rising on whether OpenAI would allocate its
assets to the non-profit arm fairly, since Reuters first
reported in September its plans for the change in structure.
SoftBank Group <9984.T> is in talks to lead a funding round of
up to $40 billion in OpenAI at a valuation of $300 billion,
including the new funds, Reuters reported in January, meaning
the non-profit could own a stake with significant value in the
company.

    By Jonathan Guilford
       NEW YORK, Feb 11 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Artificial
intelligence is not a normal technology. This maxim guides
potentially trillions of dollars of capital, investor glee and
pain, and the clout of OpenAI boss Sam Altman and his nemesis
Elon Musk. Their years-long feud cranked up on Monday, when the
Tesla <TSLA.O> boss submitted a $97.4 billion bid for the
non-profit, controlling the ChatGPT maker. It’s a perfect
illustration of AI absurdity meeting founder’s syndrome. 
    Altman and Musk co-founded OpenAI as a charity in 2015 with
the ostensible mission of safely guiding an existentially
dangerous technology. But building ever more powerful models
required more capital than could be gleaned from donations. Musk
sought influence and control in return for his resources, OpenAI
claims; Altman instead set up a “capped-profit” subsidiary,
soliciting investments from Microsoft <MSFT.O> and others. The
pair split, acrimoniously. 
    Musk is accustomed to getting his own way. His one major
setback was being ousted as boss of payments firm PayPal
<PYPL.O> in 2000. That pales next to taking control of Tesla,
engineering a merger with his fellow company SolarCity,
“negotiating” a $56 billion pay package, and upping sticks from
Delaware when a judge called foul. And, of course, he sued
OpenAI - now in a precarious position as it attempts to
transition into a for-profit company. How the non-profit arm,
which still holds a controlling stake, is valued in the shift is
a delicate legal matter that Musk could muddy. 
    This is textbook founder’s syndrome: when an autocratic boss
demands total, unchallenged control. Musk’s case is
super-charged by investor largesse. Shares of $1.1 trillion
Tesla trade at an eye-watering 128 times expected earnings for
the next 12 months, according to LSEG, conferring vast wealth on
its boss. These runaway hopes are fueled by AI, which Musk
promises Tesla will lead in. His separate artificial
intelligence business, xAI, is valued at $50 billion.
    Yet Tesla’s self-driving cars and humanoid robots are yet to
materialize. OpenAI might seem a more solid bet: actually
existing AI application ChatGPT rocketed to 100 million weekly
active users at speed; it anticipates $11.6 billion in revenue
this year, the New York Times reported. But its $157 billion
valuation already relied on aggressive growth to $100 billion in
sales, and the company may bag a $300 billion price tag from
SoftBank <9984.T>. The significance of the number Musk and a
consortium of investors put on the arm controlling this value, a
hazy extrapolation of the worth of a nascent technology, seems
limited to its usefulness in gumming up OpenAI's conversion.
    What is clear is that Altman, having parried Musk once
before surviving his own near-coup, is also not used to hearing
no. A showdown seems inevitable. A contest over OpenAI is one
over the avatar of the market mania that cemented both men’s
positions. What self-respecting founder could let it go?

      Tesla chief has no plans to acquire TikTok bid 
    

        * 
      Trump says a decision on TikTok could arrive in February
    

  
    By Gursimran  Mehar
       Feb 8(Reuters) - Billionaire Elon Musk said that he was
not interested in purchasing TikTok, the popular short-video app
that the United States has been trying to ban over national
security concerns with its Chinese owner ByteDance.
    Musk's comments, made in late January, were released online
Saturday by The WELT Group, a part of the German media company
Axel Springer SE, which hosted a summit, where the Tesla
<TSLA.O> chief joined the conference via video. 
    ""I have not put in a bid for TikTok,"" Musk said a week after
U.S. President Donald Trump said he was open to Musk buying the
ByteDance-owned app if he wanted to do so.
    ""I don't have any plans for what I would do if I had
TikTok,"" Musk said, adding that he does not use the short video
app personally, and was not familiar with the app's format. 
    ""I'm not chomping at the bit to acquire TikTok, I do not
acquire companies in general, it's quite rare,"" Musk said,
adding that his billion-dollar acquisition of social media
platform Twitter, now called X, was unusual. 
    ""I usually build companies from scratch,"" Musk said. 
    The Republican president signed an executive order seeking
to delay the enforcement of a ban on the popular short-video app
that was slated to be shuttered on January 19. 
    ByteDance was given the January deadline to sell the U.S.
assets of TikTok or face a U.S. ban, following lawmakers'
concerns that the app poses national security risks because
China could compel the company to share the data of its U.S.
users. TikTok has denied that it has or ever would share U.S.
user data.
    Apple and Google have not reinstated TikTok to their app
stores since a U.S. law took effect. TikTok said on Friday that
it was allowing U.S. Android users to download and connect to
the app through package kits on its website, in an effort to
circumvent restrictions on the popular platform in the country.
   Trump has said that he was in talks with multiple people over
TikTok's purchase and would likely have a decision on the app's
future this month. It has about 170 million American users.
    This week, the president signed an executive order to create
a sovereign wealth fund within the year, saying it could
potentially buy TikTok.
    ByteDance has previously denied any plans to sell TikTok. 
    Trump saving TikTok represents a reversal in stance from his
first term in office when he unsuccessfully sought to ban the
app over concerns the company was sharing Americans' personal
information with the Chinese government.
    More recently, Trump has said he has ""a warm spot in my
heart for TikTok,"" crediting the app with helping him win over
young voters in the 2024 presidential election. 
    ByteDance and TikTok did not immediately respond to a
request for comment outside regular business hours.

    By Robyn Mak and Katrina Hamlin
       HONG KONG, Feb 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Speed may not
be of the essence when it comes to carmaking M&A. Taiwan's Hon
Hai Precision <2317.TW>, also known as Foxconn, has an
opportunity to swoop in on Nissan Motor <7201.T> now that the
Japanese manufacturer's merger talks with rival Honda Motor 
<7267.T> have stalled. But a closer look suggests troubled
Nissan is not a must-have for boss Young Liu.
    True, the $75 billion company's years-long foray into
electric vehicles has underwhelmed so far. It raced into joint
ventures at home and abroad and even bought a factory in the
U.S. from startup Lordstown Motor in 2022. It also inked an
assembly agreement with another EV darling, Fisker, with plans
to open another factory stateside. Liu's ambition was to
replicate Foxconn's success in making iPhones for Apple
<AAPL.O>, hoping ultimately to make Teslas for Tesla <TSLA.O>,
and grab a 5% share in global EV production by 2025.
    Fierce competition from Chinese brands, slowing demand and a
raft of bankruptcies among EV startups - including both
Lordstown and Fisker - have derailed most of those plans. Last
year, Foxconn's EV strategy chief, Jun Seki, admitted that it
will probably take another five years for its U.S. factory to
reach full production capacity of 350,000 vehicles a year,
though for which brands remains unclear.
    Against this backdrop, Nissan, Seki's former employer, looks
a tempting target. Foxconn founder Terry Gou has long wanted his
firm to compete with consumer brands. Bagging a household name
like Nissan would be a big step up. Moreover, Nissan's annual
production capacity of 4 million vehicles across the U.S., China
and Europe would turbo-charge the Taiwanese group's output.
    Yet Nissan is forecast to log a 70%-plus year-on-year fall
in operating profit in the fiscal year to the end of March 2025,
per analyst estimates gathered on LSEG. Moreover, its forecast
operating profit margin is less than 2%, below Foxconn's
already-uninspiring 3% expected for this year. Crucially, Nissan
is a battery laggard: only 16% of its 2024 sales were electric
or hybrid vehicles.    
    There are other hazards. U.S. President Donald Trump has
threatened tariffs against Canada and Mexico, a key
manufacturing hub for Nissan's U.S. business. And Foxconn's own
M&A track record does not inspire confidence either: in 2016, it
splashed out $3.5 billion for control of Japan's Sharp <6753.T>.
The Tokyo-traded stock has since delivered total returns of
negative 16% compared with a near-190% gain for the Nikkei 225
Index <.N225> over the same period. Liu has reason to drive
carefully this time around.

 (Adds governance expert's quote and context in paragraphs 8,9
and no immediate Ben & Jerry's response to comment request in
paragraph 4)
    By Jessica DiNapoli and Jonathan Stempel
       NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Ben & Jerry's ratcheted up
its censorship lawsuit against Unilever <ULVR.L> on Friday,
accusing its parent company of suppressing a social policy
statement the U.S. ice cream maker wanted to release because it
mentioned President Donald Trump.
    The allegation came in an amended complaint filed in
Manhattan federal court, where Ben & Jerry's in November accused
Unilever of silencing its attempts to express support for
Palestinian refugees and end military aid to Israel, and
threatening to dismantle its independent board.
    Ben & Jerry's wants a court order freeing the board to
continue oversight of its social mission, and requiring Unilever
to honor its commitment to make $25 million of payments to
groups chosen by the ice cream company.
    Unilever and Ben & Jerry's did not immediately respond to
requests for comment.
    Both companies have been publicly at odds since 2021 when
Ben & Jerry's decided to stop selling Cherry Garcia, Chubby
Hubby and other ice cream flavors in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank because it was inconsistent with the company's values.
    That led some investors to divest Unilever shares, and Ben &
Jerry's to sue its parent for selling its Israeli business to a
local licensee.
    A settlement in 2022 required Unilever to respect Ben &
Jerry's independent board and social mission, as well as make
the $25 million of payments. 
    London-based Unilever since then announced plans to spin out
its ice cream business, including Ben & Jerry's, to simplify its
product portfolio and cut costs. The lawsuit, however, could
complicate those plans.
    ""It doesn’t help it, because anytime you have a cloud over
it, it makes it harder to either sell it or spin it out. It
affects folks' interpretation of its value,"" said Charles Elson,
a retired University of Delaware law professor and a corporate
governance expert.
    
    DONALD TRUMP, NELSON PELTZ AND ELON MUSK
    In the amended complaint, Ben & Jerry's said its management
and board, with input from Unilever's global head of litigation,
worked after Trump's election on a post to be released on
Inauguration Day, discussing hot-button issues such as abortion,
climate change, minimum wages and universal healthcare.
    But on Jan. 18, two days before Trump's inauguration,
Unilever ice cream chief Peter ter Kulve ""unilaterally barred
Ben & Jerry's from issuing the post because it specifically
mentioned 'Donald Trump,'"" the complaint said.
    Ben & Jerry's said ter Kulve appeared to base his decision
on intuition, while ignoring the company's history of
challenging the Trump administration.
    It also said ter Kulve soon held a town hall meeting where
he touted how Unilever board member and activist investor Nelson
Peltz, a Trump supporter, had introduced the president to Elon
Musk, the Tesla <TSLA.O> founder and close Trump adviser.
    The complaint said that according to ter Kulve, ""despite
four decades of progressive social activism--and years of
challenging the Trump administration’s policies
specifically--criticizing Trump was now too taboo for the brand
synonymous with 'Peace, Love, and Ice Cream.'""
    Many companies in retail, banking and other sectors have
curtailed support this month for programs whose perceived social
impact has drawn opposition from Trump and his supporters.
    
    RESISTANCE TO PAYMENTS
    Ben & Jerry's was founded by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield
in a renovated gas station in 1978, and kept its socially
conscious mission after Unilever bought it in 2000.
    According to the amended complaint, Ben & Jerry's planned to
direct $5 million from Unilever to human rights groups, and $20
million over 10 years to support Palestinian almond farmers and
a fair trade almond supplier it had long used.
    It said Unilever opposed the $5 million of payments because
it believed they would support ""Palestinian human rights,"" and
has not made the second $2.5 million installment.
    Ben & Jerry's also said ter Kulve resisted the $20 million
payment because he disliked the 2022 settlement and had not
heard of the almond supplier.
    Unilever's dozens of other products include Dove soap,
Hellmann's mayonnaise, Knorr bouillon cubes, Surf detergent and
Vaseline petroleum jelly.

       DUBAI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed
Bin Talal's investment company Kingdom Holding (KHC) <4280.SE>
would be interested in investing in ByteDance's TikTok if Elon
Musk or others offered to buy it, CEO Talal Ibrahim al-Maiman
told Al Arabiya TV on Wednesday.  
    The search to find a buyer for the Chinese-owned popular
short-video app continues in the U.S. after it went dark and was
revived later by an executive order signed by President Donald
Trump delaying the enforcement of a ban on it by 75 days.
    Trump said on Tuesday he was open to billionaire Musk buying
the app if the Tesla <TSLA.O> CEO wanted to do so.
    KHC already holds stakes in Musk's social media platform X
and his artificial intelligence startup xAI. 
    Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund PIF holds a minority
stake in KHC, with 5% of the company floated on the Saudi stock
exchange.
    Al-Maiman expected low-cost Saudi airline flynas, in which
KHC has substantial shares, to be in the final stage of getting
approval from Saudi regulator CMA to be listed, he added on the
sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 
    While KHC, founded by Saudi Arabia’s self-styled Warren
Buffett, Prince Alwaleed, holds a large diverse portfolio that
includes petrochemicals, healthcare, real estate and e-commerce,
the company wasn't rushing into the cryptocurrency market. 
    ""We support Mr. Buffet's theory what you don't buy with,
don't invest in, so as we cannot buy any goods with
cryptocurrencies therefore we are currently not looking in
investing in them,"" al-Maiman said.

    By Jennifer Saba and Karen Kwok
       NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It’s only
fitting that TikTok’s fate turn into a wild dance. As the U.S.
Supreme Court weighs up the constitutionality of a proposed ban
on the popular video app, Beijing has pirouetted into the
possibility of letting ByteDance sell it to Elon Musk, the boss
of Tesla <TSLA.O> and owner of social media site X. With so many
stakeholders, however, it will take more than just two to tango.
    Chinese officials, who previously had signaled they would
not let TikTok be owned by anyone else, have changed their tune,
according to a Bloomberg report on Monday. Floating Musk as a
possibility might involve some political motivation, given the
billionaire’s mooted advisory role in President-elect Donald
Trump’s administration. TikTok, led by Shou Zi Chew, called the
article “pure fiction.”
    The timing is auspicious, with the deadline for a
legislatively passed and presidentially upheld ban fast
approaching on Sunday. Trump’s attorneys asked the top U.S.
court in December to delay the cutoff date so when he moves back
into the White House the following day, he has room to negotiate
a deal of some kind.
    TikTok, assuming its vaunted algorithm and other
intellectual property are included in any sale, will appeal to
many suitors. With its 170 million users and, according to
Bernstein analysts, about $20 billion of estimated revenue this
year, it would be pricey, too, under normal circumstances. The
business is unprofitable, but it’s also growing faster than
publicly traded peers. Average out the multiples imputed to Meta
Platforms <META.O>, Alphabet <GOOGL.O>, Pinterest <PINS.N> and
Snap <SNAP.N> as a guide, and on about 5 times the top line, the
TikTok enterprise is theoretically worth more than $100 billion.
    Considering it would be a distressed deal, to say the least,
there probably would be a discount. Plenty of deep-pocketed
suitors already have queued up. Software goliath Oracle <ORCL.N>
is a TikTok partner and was set to buy 20% of a differently
structured version of the company alongside Walmart <WMT.N> back
in 2020. Microsoft <MSFT.O> also has expressed interest in the
past, and former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and
ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick are circling. It’s hard
to imagine Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg standing by idly.
    The circumstances are further complicated by ByteDance’s
ownership group, including investment goliaths General Atlantic
and BlackRock <BLK.N>, who may push for a proper auction. Trump
will want to help choreograph the action, the Supreme Court may
add another shuffle-step and Beijing could yet moonwalk out
again. It’s all part of TikTok’s clumsy offbeat movements.

    By Lewis Krauskopf and Suzanne McGee
       NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Donald Trump's inauguration
on Monday could herald a more volatile period for markets, with
the Republican seen moving quickly on a wide swath of issues
including trade and immigration that are expected to swing asset
prices.
    Trump's tariff plans could further fan inflation fears that
pressures bond and stock prices, while efforts to tighten
immigration controls could also reverberate through those
markets. Moves to ease regulation are poised to lift assets,
including crypto and bank stocks. 
    ""The markets will be very sensitive to this speech,"" said
Jeff Muhlenkamp, a portfolio manager at investment management
firm Muhlenkamp & Co. ""Everyone right now is trying to parse
every word and nuance that comes from Trump or his biggest
allies.”
    Some prices already incorporate Trump's expected policy
aims, among them tax cuts, reduced regulations and tariffs on
foreign imports. The address could also lay the groundwork for
White House actions in the coming days and weeks.
    “Financial markets are primed to move on any indication that
the new administration might pursue a different course than it
has telegraphed up until now,” said Doug Peta, chief U.S.
strategist at BCA Research.    
    In general, stocks have had a tepid reaction to presidential
inauguration, although this time could be different given
Trump's potential to be unpredictable and ability to shake
markets with his commentary, investors said.
    With inaugurations since World War II, the S&P 500 has
posted an average decline of 0.27%, with the index rising or
falling on about half the occasions on the day of the speeches
themselves or on the first day of trading following instances
markets were closed, according to LSEG data.
    Following Trump's last inaugural address, in January 2017,
the S&P 500 ended up 0.3% on the day. The U.S. stock and bond
markets are closed on Monday, which is also the Martin Luther
King holiday, so much of the trading reaction may not be evident
until Tuesday.
    During the entirety of Trump's first term, the S&P 500 rose
nearly 68%, but markets saw bouts of volatility, stemming in
part from a trade war Trump fought with China.
     
    STEAM BEHIND TRUMP TRADE?  
    Of course, investors for months have been shifting
portfolios based on the impending change in the White House,
with many so-called ""Trump trades"" gaining steam even ahead of
the November election when he was leading in polls and betting
markets.
    For example, shares of Tesla <TSLA.O>, which is led by Trump
backer Elon Musk, have soared 60% since the Nov 5 election.
Other gainers include bitcoin, which has jumped over 30% since
Trump's win amid optimism for a friendlier regulatory
environment, and private prison stocks Geo Group <GEO.N> and
CoreCivic <CXW.N>, which have climbed about 100% and 60%,
respectively, as investors anticipate an immigration crackdown
could increase need for detention centers.
    ""The markets are trying to start to price in policy before
the policy has come into vision in any clear way,"" said Tony
Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust. 
    Some ""Trump trades,"" however, have faded. Those include
shares of regional banks and small-cap companies, which are both
expected to benefit from a de-regulation push under Trump, and
have given up at least some of their post-election gains. 
    The broader stock market has also lost steam. Optimism over
Trump's expected pro-growth agenda including reduced taxes and
regulations broadly benefited equities following the election.
    But the S&P 500 has pulled back and is now up about 1% since
Nov 5. Persistent inflation is leading markets to predict the
Federal Reserve will end its interest rate cutting cycle sooner
than previously hoped, undercutting the stock market's momentum.
   

    WARY OF TARIFF TALK
    Investors are wary of specific topics causing ruptures.  
    David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer at DWS
Group, will be listening for any hints about tariff
introductions in the inauguration speech, adding that ""Trump has
got the ability to take action on tariffs and he probably does
very quickly"" and that such comments could ""sour the mood for
investors."" 
    In particular, Bianco said, ""the bond market should be on
guard"" for Trump's comments. Benchmark Treasury yields, which
rise when bond prices fall, on Friday hit their highest levels
since November 2023 after a blowout U.S. jobs report fueled more
inflation anxiety.
    Investors are mindful Trump may voice some unusual ideas,
along the lines of his recently expressed desire to annex
Greenland, or tout goals that suggest major spending, which
could exacerbate concerns about the expanding fiscal deficit. 
    Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital
Markets, said he is watching which business leaders might be
attending the inauguration events.
    ""That could speak a little more to the individual companies
that are looking to get an inside track with the White House,""
Woods said.
    Alex Morris, president and chief investment officer of F/m
Investments, said he will be listening for Trump's tone,
including “every sentence that focuses on his anger rather than
policy or platitudes.""
    ""The longer that anger continues,"" Morris said, ""the more
likely it is that bonds get cheaper, equities get cheaper.""

 (Adds details from complaint, additional comment from Musk
lawyer in paragraph 9, background from paragraph 12, case
citation in paragraph 22)
    By Jonathan Stempel
       Jan 14 (Reuters) - Elon Musk was sued on Tuesday by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused the
world's richest person of waiting too long to disclose in 2022
he had amassed a large stake in Twitter, the social media
company he later bought.
    In a complaint filed in Washington, D.C. federal court, the
SEC said Musk violated federal securities law by waiting 11 days
too long to disclose his initial purchase of 5% of Twitter's
common shares.
    An SEC rule requires investors to disclose within 10
calendar days, or by March 24, 2022 in Musk's case, when they
cross a 5% ownership threshold.
    The SEC said that at the expense of unsuspecting investors,
Musk instead bought more than $500 million of Twitter shares at
artificially low prices before finally revealing his purchases
on April 4, 2022, by which time he owned a 9.2% stake.
    Twitter's share price rose more than 27% following that
disclosure, the SEC said.
    Tuesday's lawsuit seeks to force Musk to pay a civil fine
and disgorge profits he didn't deserve.
    Musk eventually purchased Twitter for $44 billion in October
2022, and renamed it X.
    Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, in an email called the SEC
lawsuit the culmination of the regulator's ""multi-year campaign
of harassment"" against his client.
    ""Today's action is an admission by the SEC that they cannot
bring an actual case,"" he said. ""Mr. Musk has done nothing wrong
and everyone sees this sham for what it is.""
    Spiro added that the lawsuit addresses a mere ""alleged
administrative failure to file a single form--an offense that,
even if proven, carries a nominal penalty.""
    
    OTHER LAWSUITS OVER TWITTER PURCHASES
    Musk, an adviser to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, is
worth $417 billion according to Forbes magazine, through
businesses such as the electric car maker Tesla <TSLA.O> and
rocket company SpaceX.
    He is worth nearly twice as much as Amazon.com <AMZN.O>
founder Jeff Bezos, the world's second-richest person at $232
billion, Forbes said.
    The SEC sued Musk six days before Trump's Jan. 20
inauguration.
    SEC Chair Gary Gensler is stepping down that day, and Paul
Atkins, who Trump nominated to succeed him, is expected to
review many of Gensler's rules and enforcement actions.  
    Musk has also been sued in Manhattan federal court by former
Twitter shareholders over the late disclosure.
    In that case, Musk has said it was implausible to believe he
wanted to defraud other shareholders, and that ""all indications""
were that his delay was a mistake.
    Musk has long feuded with the SEC, including after it sued
him in 2018 over his Twitter posts about possibly taking Tesla
private and having secured funding to do so.
    He settled that lawsuit by paying a $20 million civil fine,
agreeing to have Tesla lawyers review some Twitter posts in
advance, and giving up his role as Tesla's chairman.
    The SEC also sought sanctions from Musk after he missed
court-ordered testimony last September for the Twitter probe, so
he could attend the launch of SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission at
Florida's Cape Canaveral.
    A federal judge in San Francisco rejected that request,
because Musk later testified and agreed to pay the SEC's travel
costs.
    The case is SEC v Musk, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia, No. 25-00105.

    By Katrina Hamlin
       HONG KONG, Jan 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The world's
largest battery maker is determined to shore up its dominance. A
planned Hong Kong listing for China's Contemporary Amperex
Technology <300750.SZ> could raise up to $5 billion, according
to IFR. The share sale would fund factories abroad. It would
also insulate its war chest from global foreign exchange
ructions.
    Robin Zeng is in a strong position. Earnings at the $150
billion company he founded are accelerating faster than its
investments, according to forecasts gathered by Visible Alpha.
While capital expenditure may swell from $4.3 billion in 2024 to
nearly $6 billion in 2028, CATL's net cash could nearly triple
to roughly $60 billion over the same period, per those analyst
estimates.
    However, while much of that wealth remains in mainland
China, where it is subject to stringent capital controls, CATL’s
next big steps will be overseas. The U.S. Defense Department's
move on Monday to add the group to a list of entities it says
work with China’s military jeopardises deals it has struck to
license its technology to Ford Motor <F.N> and Tesla <TSLA.O> as
well as other opportunities in the country. But CATL has
committed to a $7.6 billion plant in Hungary, a $4.2 billion
joint venture with Stellantis <STLAM.MI> in Spain, a partnership
in Indonesia, and a new R&D hub in Hong Kong. The battery maker
has also weighed up investment opportunities from Thailand to
Mexico, according to Reuters and Bloomberg. 
    To support its vast ambitions, the group tried repeatedly to
raise equity abroad to supplement offshore debt. Two years ago,
it explored issuing global depositary receipts in Switzerland,

    By Katrina Hamlin
       HONG KONG, Jan 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The world's
largest battery maker is determined to shore up its dominance. A
planned Hong Kong listing for China's Contemporary Amperex
Technology <300750.SZ> could raise up to $5 billion, according
to IFR. The share sale would fund factories abroad. It would
also insulate its war chest from global foreign exchange
ructions.
    Robin Zeng is in a strong position. Earnings at the $150
billion company he founded are accelerating faster than its
investments, according to forecasts gathered by Visible Alpha.
While capital expenditure may swell from $4.3 billion in 2024 to
nearly $6 billion in 2028, CATL's net cash could nearly triple
to roughly $60 billion over the same period, per those analyst
estimates.
    However, while much of that wealth remains in mainland
China, where it is subject to stringent capital controls, CATL’s
next big steps will be overseas. The U.S. Defense Department's
move on Monday to add the group to a list of entities it says
work with China’s military jeopardises deals it has struck to
license its technology to Ford Motor <F.N> and Tesla <TSLA.O> as
well as other opportunities in the country. But CATL has
committed to a $7.6 billion plant in Hungary, a $4.2 billion
joint venture with Stellantis <STLAM.MI> in Spain, a partnership
in Indonesia, and a new R&D hub in Hong Kong. The battery maker
has also weighed up investment opportunities from Thailand to
Mexico, according to Reuters and Bloomberg. 
    To support its vast ambitions, the group tried repeatedly to
raise equity abroad to supplement offshore debt. Two years ago,
it explored issuing global depositary receipts in Switzerland,
only to face regulatory concerns. A weak market frustrated a
Hong Kong listing in early 2024.  
    Success this time could limit CATL’s exposure to a weakening
yuan: analysts polled by LSEG think the currency could fall as
much as 10% against the U.S. dollar this year, doubtless driven
at least in part by incoming President Donald Trump's tariff

       NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Tidal Partners, a mergers
and acquisitions advisory firm launched in 2022 by former
Centerview Partners dealmakers, has hired investment banker
Anand Sankaralingam from Evercore <EVR.N>, according to people
familiar with the matter.
    Sankaralingam, who joined Evercore in 2014 and is currently
on gardening leave, will start his new role at Tidal Partners
this month and focus on dealmaking in the software industry, the
sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private.  
    Sankaralingam, who will be based in Palo Alto, California,
has advised on deals involving companies such as Palo Alto
Networks <PANW.O>, Tesla <TSLA.O>, Facebook <META.O>, Yahoo,
Aruba, EverCommerce <EVCM.O>, eSentire, and Intapp <INTA.O>. 
    Prior to his stint at Evercore, Sankaralingam was an
engineer at Netflix and Yahoo for more than six years, according
to his LinkedIn profile. 
    Tidal Partners declined to comment. Evercore did not respond
to requests for comment.
    Palo Alto-based Tidal Partners was started by veteran
technology bankers David Handler and David Neequaye. Their firm,
which employs about 30 people, according to its website, has
advised on notable transactions including Cisco Systems'
<CSCO.O> $28 billion acquisition of cybersecurity firm Splunk -
a deal which closed last year. 
    Tidal Partners has also advised on other deals, including
ServiceNow's <NOW.N> acquisition of G2K Group and Bloom Energy's
<BE.N> $550 million convertible notes offering. Last year, the
firm worked with software maker OpenGov on its $1.8 billion sale
to family-owned communications services provider Cox
Enterprises.

T he man credited with writing “The Art of the Deal” is turning
out to be more muse than creator. With his return to the White
House, Donald Trump will help inspire a fresh wave of corporate
mergers already primed by lower borrowing costs, surging stock
markets, growing confidence and itchy buyout firms. Strategists
at Morgan Stanley are predicting a roughly 50% pickup in M&A
activity in 2025, double the 2024 growth rate. The promise of a
laxer regulatory regime invites fresh perspective on old ideas,
and Breakingviews is ready with a gallery of transactions to
showcase the aesthetic of postBidenism.
    Rivian Automotive <RIVN.O> paints part of the picture. The
Tesla <TSLA.O> rival faces nagging supply snarls and weakening
demand for electric vehicles. Trump’s plans to slash regulations
and end subsidies for consumers will also take a toll on a
company with some $10 billion in losses expected through 2027,
according to Visible Alpha. Boss RJ Scaringe already secured a
$5 billion lifeline through a partnership with Volkswagen
<VOWG_p.DE>, but selling to the German carmaker is shaping up to
be his best bet.
    Exxon Mobil <XOM.N>, meanwhile, will cater to Trump’s
preferred medium: oil. For now, the energy titan led by Darren
Woods is battling rival Chevron <CVX.N> over its $53 billion
takeover of Hess because of the prized Guyana offshore field
that’s involved. There’s more to save than just legal fees by
merging instead. Exxon and Chevron toyed with the idea of
combining in 2020, when the cost savings might have been worth
more than $20 billion. Consolidation makes sense in an
increasingly taboo industry awash with crude, and the idea of a
national champion created under his watch might suit the
president-elect.
    Comcast <CMCSA.O> boss Brian Roberts has struggled to sketch
out new deals of late. A friendlier Federal Communications
Commission will enable him to revisit the 2015 idea of
swallowing up Time Warner Cable, which he abandoned over
the fear of trustbusters, allowing John Malone’s Charter
Communications <CHTR.O> to buy it instead. Luckily, the cable
cowboy now wants to simplify his empire. For Roberts, using the
same logic as in previous estimates, a combination would lead to
synergies worth $35 billion. It’ll be a tempting transaction
under the TV-watcher-in-chief.
    Even Google owner Alphabet <GOOGL.O> will be emboldened. The
company is fighting off the U.S. government’s attempts to break
it up and Trump’s trustbusters may only be slightly more open to
the idea of Big Tech getting bigger. Nevertheless, the web
search giant as recently as 2024 considered buying marketing
software developer HubSpot <HUBS.N> and held talks to acquire
cybersecurity startup Wiz, either of which would have been the
biggest deal in its history. Wiz might even represent a sort of
regulatory détente, with the government deeming that Google’s
pursuit of additional safeguards against hackers mitigate
concerns about its dominance elsewhere.
    Trump himself looks at Washington as something of a blank
canvas. He already has Tesla boss Elon Musk on the hunt for
sweeping cost cuts across the bureaucracy. And since mergers are
prime ways to reduce expenses, uniting the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which has a $2.1 billion annual budget and
roughly 5,000 staffers, with the smaller Commodity Futures
Trading Commission would make financial and strategic sense,
eliminating an anachronistic redundancy and aligning the United
States with other countries that police derivatives and stocks
under one roof. Tedious turf battles, like the one over which
agency has jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies, would come to an
end in a master stroke.

2024-12-26 13:30:00,BREAKINGVIEWS-SpaceX will be a better $1 trln bet than Tesla,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20241226:nL3N3MY1G9:1,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.  The opinions

    By Robert Cyran
       NEW YORK, Dec 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Rocket maker
SpaceX’s internal $350 billion valuation makes it among the
globe’s most valuable private startups. That’s still a fraction
of the worth of boss Elon Musk’s electric-car company Tesla
<TSLA.O>, which sports a $1 trillion market value. In 2025,
though, it will become clear that terrestrial ambitions are no
match for the stars.
    SpaceX encapsulates Musk’s philosophy: do something
different, then cut costs to drive out the competition. Sure,
Tesla’s 2006 “master plan” similarly pitched producing a premium
car and then using the profits to drive down-market. But
SpaceX’s growth is more explosive – and harder to catch.
    The key is Starlink, SpaceX’s broadband satellite network.
Its success is twofold. First, by building bigger rockets that
can be reused, costs to launch tumble precipitously. Second,
Starlink’s superior performance versus rivals ensures a revenue
stream that justifies more launches. The company has around
7,000 satellites whizzing around Earth and is adding about 60 a
week. From 1965 to the early 2010s, there was essentially no
growth in manmade objects launched into space. Starlink turned
that trajectory parabolic.
    This is an emergent monopoly. SpaceX accounted for over 85%
of all orbital payloads in 2024’s first quarter, estimates
BryceTech. This rapidly scaling vertical integration –
encompassing rockets, satellites and user terminals – puts
would-be rivals like Amazon on the back foot.
    Tesla faces fierce competition from upstarts like China’s
BYD <002594.SZ> and cheaper, good-enough fossil-fuel cars.
SpaceX enjoys much clearer skies. Starlink only has 5 million
users but is available in 114 countries. It’s adding cellphone
service and has plenty of capacity. Musk’s connections to
President-elect Donald Trump may help it land previously
unavailable subsidies, such as $42 billion for rural U.S.
broadband.
    That leaves plenty of upside from the $6.6 billion of
revenue that consultancy Quilty Space predicts for Starlink in
2024. EBITDA is projected to hit $3.8 billion, an astonishing
58% margin. TMF Associates foresees $24 billion of revenue by
2030. At today’s estimated profitability, that’s $18 billion of
EBITDA. Given high fixed costs, more users could improve the
bottom line.
    So what is Starlink worth? Tesla trades at 68 times EBITDA,
despite sputtering growth. Assume Starlink’s growth continues on
its forecast path, put it on Tesla’s multiple, and the
communications business would, at the end of the decade, be
valued at well over $1 trillion. That’s not even counting
SpaceX’s other valuable businesses like rockets.
    Ultimately, it’s not clear why SpaceX is worth so little,
Tesla so much, or both. As self-driving gets a reality check
while the one-man space race continues, it will become clear
that the stars are Musk’s real frontier.

    By Maki Shiraki and Norihiko Shirouzu
       TOKYO, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Honda <7267.T> and Nissan
<7201.T> are in talks to deepen ties, two people said on
Wednesday, including a possible merger, the clearest sign yet of
how Japan's once seemingly unbeatable auto industry is being
reshaped by challenges from Tesla and Chinese rivals.
    A combined Honda and Nissan would create a $54 billion
company with annual output of 7.4 million vehicles, making it
the world's third-largest auto group by vehicle sales after
Toyota <7203.T> and Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>.
    The two firms already forged a strategic partnership in
March to cooperate in electric vehicle development, but Nissan's
deepening financial and strategic trouble in recent months has
added more urgency for closer cooperation with larger rival
Honda.
    Nissan announced a $2.6 billion cost savings plan last month
that includes cutting 9,000 jobs and 20% of its global
production capacity, as slumping sales in China and the United
States led to an 85% plunge in second-quarter profit. 
    ""This deal appears to be more about bailing out Nissan, but
Honda itself is not resting on its laurels,"" said Sanshiro
Fukao, executive fellow at Itochu Research Institute. ""Honda's
cash flow is set to deteriorate next year and its EVs haven't
been going so well.""
    Shares of Nissan closed nearly 24% higher in Tokyo trade on
Wednesday, while shares of Honda, whose market value of $43
billion is more than four times bigger than that of Nissan,
declined 3%. Shares of Mitsubishi Motors <7211.T>, in which
Nissan is the top shareholder with a 24% stake, gained nearly
20%.
    The automakers have been grappling with challenges from EV
makers, particularly in China, where BYD <002594.SZ> <1211.HK>
and others have surged ahead. 
    U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is also threatening hefty
tariffs on vehicles shipped from Canada and Mexico to the U.S.,
adding further pressure on the companies. Honda and Nissan both
produce cars in Mexico for export to the United States.
    The talks between Honda and Nissan, first reported by the
Nikkei newspaper, could allow the companies to cooperate more on
technology and help them create a more formidable domestic rival
to Toyota. 
    The discussions are focused on finding ways to bolster
collaboration and include the possibility of setting up a
holding company, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the information has not been made public. 
    The companies are also discussing the possibility of a full
merger, according to one of the people, as well as looking at
ways to cooperate with Mitsubishi.
    Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi said no deal had been announced
by any of the companies, though Nissan and Mitsubishi noted the
three automakers had said previously they were considering
opportunities for future collaboration. 
    French automaker Renault <RENA.PA>, Nissan's largest
shareholder, is open in principle to a deal and would examine
all the implications of a tie-up, two people familiar with the
matter said.
    A Renault spokesperson declined to comment.
    Renault shares were up 6.7% at 1352 GMT, set for its best
day in just under 2-1/2 years.
    The three Japanese automakers are expected to hold a joint
news conference in Tokyo on Monday, according to a source
familiar with the matter. 
    Taiwan's Foxconn <2317.TW>, which manufactures Apple's
<AAPL.O> iPhones and has been seeking to expand its nascent EV
contract manufacturing business, approached Nissan about a bid
but it was rejected by the Japanese firm, two separate sources
familiar with the matter said.
    Bloomberg News reported earlier on Wednesday that Foxconn
had approached Nissan to take a controlling stake.
    Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for
comment, while a Nissan spokesperson declined to comment on
Foxconn.  
      
    
    CHANGING LANDSCAPE
    Any merger would face significant U.S. scrutiny after Trump
has vowed to take a hard line on imported vehicles. He could
seek concessions from Honda and Nissan to approve any deal, auto
industry officials said.
    Over the past year, an EV price war launched by Tesla
<TSLA.O> and BYD has intensified pressure on any automakers
losing money on the next-generation vehicles. That has pushed
companies like Honda and Nissan to seek ways to cut costs and
speed vehicle development, and mergers are a major step in that
direction.
    ""In the mid- to long-term, this is good for the Japanese car
industry as it creates a second axis against Toyota,"" said Seiji
Sugiura, a senior analyst at Tokai Tokyo Intelligence
Laboratory. 
    ""Constructive rivalry with Toyota is a positive for the
rather stagnating Japanese car industry when it must compete
with Chinese automakers, Tesla and others.""
    S&P Global Ratings said it would take time for the synergies
from a potential merger to boost the firms' creditworthiness.
    Differences in corporate culture and strategies may mean a
merger that does not give one side control is unlikely to have
meaningful results.
    ""In our view, there have been few instances where mergers
and alliances between major automakers have led to significant
benefits,"" it said in a note.
    Honda and Nissan would also have to work out how to
integrate their different corporate cultures if they proceed
with a merger, analysts said.
    ""Honda has a unique, technology-centric culture with
strengths in powertrains, so there should be some internal
resistance to the merger with Nissan, a competitor with a
different culture that is now faltering,"" said Tang Jin, a
senior researcher at Mizuho Bank.

2024-12-18 12:10:02,QUOTES-Experts' comments on talks between Honda and Nissan to deepen ties,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20241218:nL1N3NJ0DS:4,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"(Adds Subaru and S&P Ratings)
       Dec 18 (Reuters) - Honda <7267.T> and Nissan <7201.T>
are in talks to deepen ties, two people said on Wednesday,
including a possible merger, the clearest sign yet of how
Japan's once seemingly unbeatable auto industry is being
reshaped by challenges from Tesla and Chinese rivals.
    Here are comments from experts:    

    KOJI ENDO, SENIOR ANALYST AND HEAD OF EQUITY RESEARCH, SBI
SECURITIES, TOKYO:
    ""If Honda's hybrid cars are supplied to Nissan and
Mitsubishi Motors and if they can sell them, the three companies
would all be better off since that would expand the sales
channel. 
    ""The holding company scheme, rather than a merger, appears
to be the key as they can minimise the risks while taking the
benefits of integration.
    ""The question now is what will happen to Renault's 15% stake
in Nissan. Renault may completely part ways with Nissan through
selling the shares."" 

    SANSHIRO FUKAO, EXECUTIVE FELLOW, ITOCHU RESEARCH INSTITUTE,
TOKYO:
    ""This deal appears to be more about bailing out Nissan, but
Honda itself is not resting on its laurels. Honda’s cash flow is
set to deteriorate next year and its EVs haven’t been going so
well. Honda itself needs to change drastically. It may need to
spin off its motorcycle business and it should establish a solid
financial base from engine cars. If these are made easier by a
setting up a holding company (with Nissan), then that would be a
positive thing for Honda.
    ""If their thinking is no more than 'we can manage this by
getting together,' I don’t think they can survive any longer.
The speed of Chinese automakers is totally different. We’re no
longer in the age where carmakers would join together, churn out
profits through economies of scale and then reinvest them in a
five-year restructuring plan. They have no time for that.""
    
    TANG JIN, SENIOR PRINCIPAL RESEARCHER, MIZUHO BANK, TOKYO:
    ""Honda has a unique, technology-centric culture with
strengths in powertrains, so there should be some internal
resistance to the merger with Nissan, a competitor with a
different culture that is now faltering.
    ""Honda itself doesn’t have such abundant management
resources. It faces a major challenge of how it can accelerate
its shift to electrification by making money from hybrids and
motorcycles. Nissan, on the other hand, has no choice.
    ""The car industry is currently undergoing rapid changes … so
if the two companies cannot make decisions and execute them in
unison and at speed, they may not be able to keep up with the
changes.""
    
    SEIJI SUGIURA, SENIOR ANALYST, TOKAI TOKYO INTELLIGENCE
LABORATORY, TOKYO:
    ""Honda's internal opinion is probably split and not
monolithically supportive of the merger. Because their
motorcycle business is doing well. For the four-wheelers, they
certainly have problems, but they weren’t in dire straits
either.
    ""In the mid- to long-term, this is good for the Japanese car
industry as it creates a second axis against Toyota.
Constructive rivalry with Toyota is a positive for the rather
stagnating Japanese car industry when it must compete with
Chinese automakers, Tesla and others.""
    
    ATSUSHI OSAKI, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF TOYOTA-AFFILIATED JAPANESE
CARMAKER SUBARU <7270.T>:
    ""It's too much of a hurdle to do it all by one company,"" he
said, referring to the challenge of electrification facing
carmakers.
    
    S&P GLOBAL RATINGS:    
    ""Even if the two companies merge, it would take time for
synergies to have a positive impact on their creditworthiness,
in our view.
    ""The combined annual global sales of the two companies would
exceed 7 million units, which could help cut costs through
economies of scale and facilitate growth.
    ""As the auto industry shifts to electric vehicles, companies
face heavy investment burdens, including battery manufacturing
and software development.
    ""However, both companies have developed their businesses
based on their own strategies. We therefore believe it will be
difficult for them to produce significant effects quickly
through expanding the scope of their collaboration to include
batteries, software, and autonomous driving.""

2024-12-18 11:53:31,Renault shares gain on Honda-Nissan tie-up talks,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20241218:nL4N3NJ0PB:5,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"PARIS, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Renault <RENA.PA> shares
surged 6% on Wednesday as analysts highlighted financial and
strategic benefits for the automaker from a potential Honda
<7267.T> and Nissan <7201.T> merger.
    Japan's number two and three carmakers are in talks to
deepen ties, including a possible merger, two people said, as
they come under growing pressure from Tesla and Chinese rivals.
    France's Renault owns 17% of Nissan and 18.7% via a French
trust, making it Nissan's top shareholder, even after the two
firms began scaling back their longstanding alliance last year. 
    Renault shares were the second biggest gainer on the
pan-European STOXX 600 <.STOXX> index on Wednesday after the
report.
    Renault has declined to say so far whether it would sell its
shares, but two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on
Wednesday that Renault is open in principle to it pursuing
merger talks with Honda.
    Analysts said such a tie-up has positive implications for
Renault. In the short term talks support Nissan's stock,
generating more liquidity as Renault continues its strategy
begun late 2023 of selling its shares in its Japanese partner,
said Jefferies.
    It also gives Renault a potential buyer for a significant
portion of its remaining stake in Nissan, worth almost 3 billion
euros ($3.15 billion) currently, said analysts at Oddo.
    Based on current market values, Honda shareholders would
obtain around 85% of the new company and Nissan shareholders
would get the rest, with slightly more than 5% for Renault based
on its current stake in Nissan, they added.
    Honda could also become a new client for Renault's electric
vehicle unit, Ampere, in Europe, said Oddo. 
    Nissan is already a key client, relying on Renault to make
its Micra for the European markets and will also use the
platform of the Renault Twingo electric for a future model.

 (Recasts with source)
    By Maki Shiraki
       Dec 17 (Reuters) - Japanese auto giants Honda <7267.T>
and Nissan <7201.T> are in talks to set up a holding company,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter, a move that
would allow them to share more resources amid competition
upending the global industry.
    The talks, first reported by the Nikkei newspaper, would
allow the two automakers to cooperate more closely on technology
at a time when the industry is being rewritten by the likes of
Tesla <TSLA.O> and Chinese rivals.
        The talks are aimed at setting up an umbrella holding
company that Nissan and Honda would then fall under, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the information
had not been made public.
    It was not immediately clear whether a new holding company
was aimed at eventually establishing a full union between the
two companies, although Nikkei said they were beginning merger
talks. 
    The two carmakers have increased ties in recent months as
they wrestle with the changing EV landscape. As well as heavy
competition, automakers also face stalling demand in Europe and
the U.S., intensifying the pressures on them.
    Honda and Nissan on Tuesday issued identical statements
saying no merger had been announced by either company.
    ""As announced in March of this year, Honda and Nissan are
exploring various possibilities for future collaboration,
leveraging each other's strengths,"" the companies said in
separate statements, adding they will inform stakeholders of any
updates at an appropriate time.
    In addition, French automaker Renault, a major Nissan
shareholder, said it had no information and declined to comment.
    Over the past year, an EV price war launched by Tesla and
Chinese automaker BYD has only intensified pressure on any
companies losing money on the next-generation vehicles. That has
put pressure on companies like Honda and Nissan to seek ways to
cut costs and speed vehicle development, and mergers are a major
step in that direction.
    Honda's market capitalization is 5.95 trillion yen ($38.8
billion), while Nissan's is 1.17 trillion yen ($7.6 billion).
Any deal would be the biggest in the industry since the $52
billion merger between Fiat Chrysler and PSA in 2021 to create
Stellantis <STLAM.MI>.
    ""The thought that some of these smaller players can survive
and thrive is getting more challenging, especially when you add
on the complexity of all the additional Chinese manufacturers
who have come in and are competing quite strongly,"" said Edmunds
analyst Jessica Caldwell. ""It's just sort of necessary to
survive, not only to survive, but also just to afford the
future.""
    Honda's U.S.-listed shares were up 0.9% in afternoon
trading.
    Honda and Nissan, Japan's second- and third-biggest
automakers, respectively, after Toyota <7203.T>, have been
losing market share in China. That nation accounted for almost
70% of global EV sales in November, with more than 1.27 million
in purchases for the month.
    The two had combined global sales of 7.4 million vehicles in
2023, but are grappling with challenges from EV makers,
particularly in China, where BYD <002594.SZ> <1211.HK> and
others have surged ahead. 
Global automakers General Motors <GM.N> and Ford <F.N> have
slowed investments in EVs as high borrowing costs and poor
charging infrastructure hinder their adoption despite government
incentives. In September, GM said it was in talks with South
Korea's Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> to explore ways to collaborate
in a move to cut costs, including on joint vehicle development.
    Europe's car sector is in turmoil, with thousands of jobs on
the line as automakers suffer from a weakening market, high
costs, a slower-than-expected takeup of EVs and increasing
competition from Chinese rivals.
Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> has threatened to close plants in Germany
for the first time in its 87-year history, cut jobs and slash
wages to reduce costs and boost profit. Last week, Europe's top
carmaker said it will close its Audi plant in Brussels next
year. 
    In Europe, Volkswagen is locked in acrimonious talks with
its union over cost cuts as it struggles with falling demand and
rising costs.
The global auto industry is also bracing for a potential
rollback of EV-friendly policies by U.S. President-elect Donald
Trump, Reuters has reported.
    Any merger would face significant U.S. scrutiny and Trump
has vowed to take a hard line on imported vehicles - including
threatening 25% tariffs on vehicles shipped from Canada and
Mexico - and he could seek concessions from Honda and Nissan to
approve any deal, auto industry officials said. During his first
term, Trump threatened tariffs on Japanese vehicles.
    Honda and Nissan in March agreed to cooperate in their EV
businesses, and in August deepened their ties, agreeing to work
together on batteries, e-axles and other technology.
    The automakers are expected to sign a memorandum of
understanding soon for the new merged entity, the Nikkei
reported.
    Honda and Nissan are also looking to bring in Mitsubishi
Motors <7211.T>, in which Nissan is the top shareholder with a
24% stake, under the holding company, the report said.
    Mitsubishi officials did not have an immediate comment.
    Nissan has been reeling from weak demand in China and the
U.S., prompting the Japanese automaker to cut costs.
    Last month, the company said its half-year net earnings were
down more than 90% from a year ago and cut its annual operating
profit forecast by about 70%.

2024-12-17 16:35:05,Tesla castigates German union over attempt to oust works council head,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20241217:nL8N3NI1A0:9,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"FRANKFURT, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Tesla <TSLA.O> accused
Germany's IG Metall union of trying to sow unrest at the EV
maker's gigafactory near Berlin by seeking to oust the head of
the works council, in the latest sign of the sour relationship
between the two sides.
    IG Metall, Germany's most powerful union, said earlier it
had filed a motion with a local court to remove the plant's
works council head - who is not a member of the union - from the
committee.
    The union cited violations to German labour law restricting
IG Metall's influence and preventing it from properly
representing workers' interests.
    The move, which Tesla described as ""desperate"", reflects IG
Metall's efforts to improve what it says are sub-par conditions
at the factory, the only car plant in Germany not governed by a
collective wage agreement.
    The U.S. EV maker is fighting a similar battle in Sweden,
where it also refuses to sign a collective wage agreement and is
facing multiple lawsuits from the local union.
    It is also embroiled in a series of legal disputes in the
United States over employment practices, including cases
alleging unlawful anti-union conduct.
    Tesla denies that its working conditions are below average,
saying it offers equal or better terms than those negotiated by
unions.
    ""Since the start of the Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, IG
Metall has repeatedly tried to cause unrest in our factory and
put obstacles in the way of our success strategy,"" Tesla said in
a statement.
    ""Our independence and the resulting good working conditions
and secure jobs at our plant are a constant source of annoyance
for the union.""
    Earlier this year, IG Metall failed to gain a majority in
the Gruenheide gigafactory's works council, winning 40% of seats
in what it says is a pro-management group.
    In October, the union accused the plant's management of
""aggressive tactics"" against workers trying to unionise after it
fired a union representative from the council.

       Feb 24 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway <BRKa.N> shares
rose to a record on Monday after the conglomerate run by Warren
Buffett posted its highest-ever quarterly profit, driven by
improvement in insurance operations.
    The conglomerate's Class A shares closed up $28,735.49, or
4%, at $747,485.49, after earlier reaching $755,968.
        Those levels surpassed even the $741,971 recorded by
some stock price services last June 3, following a trading
glitch.
    Berkshire's more widely held Class B shares closed up
$19.68, or 4.1%, at $498.42, The Omaha, Nebraska-based
conglomerate's market value rose to $1.08 trillion.
    Multiple analysts raised their price targets and earnings
forecasts. Buffett's own fortune increased to $155.5 billion,
ranking sixth worldwide, according to Forbes magazine.
    Berkshire on Saturday said fourth-quarter profit from its
189 operating businesses rose 71% to $14.53 billion, and
excluding currency gains totaled $13.38 billion, exceeding
analyst forecasts.
    Full-year operating profit rose 27% to $47.44 billion, also
a record.
    That was also helped by more income from $334.2 billion of
cash and equivalents, invested mainly in U.S. Treasury bills.
    Cash doubled in 2024 as Berkshire reduced its stake in Apple
<AAPL.O>, still its largest common stock holding. Net income,
including gains and losses from stocks, totaled $89 billion.
    In his annual shareholder letter, Buffett said Berkshire
outpaced his expectations, and singled out Geico Chief Executive
Todd Combs for improving the car insurer's underwriting while
cutting costs.
    Geico underwriting profit more than doubled in 2024 even as
it shed more than 2,300 jobs, in addition to 7,700 in 2023.
    UBS analyst Brian Meredith and KBW analyst Meyer Shields
raised their 2025 outlooks for Berkshire, with Meredith saying
Geico ""appears to have firmly turned the corner.""
    Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan called the cash stake
noteworthy in light of Buffett's comment that Berkshire paid
$26.8 billion, or more than $3 million an hour, in federal taxes
last year. Buffett cautioned Washington to spend it ""wisely.""
    Berkshire's operations also include railroad, energy,
industrial, retail and service businesses.
    Buffett, 94, has led Berkshire since 1965.
    He wrote that ""at 94, it won't be long before Greg Abel
replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters.""

    By Jonathan Stempel
       NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway <BRKa.N>
on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash
stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual
shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely
and take care of those who get the ""short straws in life.""
    Buffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S.
lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make
them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald
Trump.
    The 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person
and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his
advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend
less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting
on May 3.
    He nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good
hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice
Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has ""vividly
shown his ability"" to deploy capital.
    ""It won't be long"" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.
    Buffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual
report, where it reported a third straight record annual
operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.
    Quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also
a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.
    Net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including
gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple
<AAPL.O> and American Express <AXP.N>.
    Berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations
and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it
bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest
stock investment.
    ""Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find
ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,"" Buffett wrote.
    
    'FISCAL FOLLY'
    This year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which
he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03
trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance,
railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.
    ""Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our
country. And we are not finished,"" Buffett said.
    Buffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities,
primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a
dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967. 
    He said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha,
Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last
year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself
is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,
    But he also sent a cautionary message to Washington,
lamenting how capitalism ""has its faults and abuses--in certain
respects more egregious now than ever,"" with malfeasance by
""scoundrels and promoters"" in full force.
    He urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar,
saying ""fiscal folly"" can destroy the value of paper money and
the country has at times ""come close to the edge.""
    Buffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American
economy, which he called the ""American miracle,"" has depended on
people's ability to participate.
    That, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take
away.
    ""Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get
the short straws in life. They deserve better,"" Buffett wrote,
addressing the government.
    ""And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable
currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on
your part,"" he added.
    Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates
Berkshire ""hold,"" said: ""Talking about the business of America
being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape
and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning
Washington: Be careful where you tread.""

    FEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES
    While Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire
company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its
combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading
houses: Itochu <8001.T>, Marubeni <8002.T>, Mitsubishi <8058.T>,
Mitsui <8031.T> and Sumitomo <8053.T>.
    Other stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500
<.SPX> hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq <.IXIC>
just 3% below its December 16 peak.
    Berkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the
indexes, as they did decades ago.
    The company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year,
while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.
    Over the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen
225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185%
excluding dividends, Reuters data show.
    ""They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire
will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,""
said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital
Management in Phoenix.
    At Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time
on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice
Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.
    Tens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend
of shareholder events, including shopping.
    Buffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still
having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while
other activities had been ""eliminated or greatly minimized.""
    The meeting will also not feature the traditional movie
created by Buffett's daughter Susie.
    In discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on
Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an
old-fashioned phone.
    ""We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting
topics as the relative merits of our canes,"" he said. ""In my
case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on
my face.""

       Feb 21 (Reuters) - Payments firm Block's <XYZ.N> shares tumbled 16% in morning trading
on Friday as a slowdown in spending growth fueled investor concerns, shifting the spotlight to
its bet on buy-now, pay-later lending to drive profits in 2025.
    Consumer spending growth has remained muted as Americans grapple with trade policy
uncertainty under the new Trump administration and persistently high interest rates, despite
support from a strong labor market and steady wage growth. 
    Block's Cash App business, which enables peer-to-peer mobile payments, reported gross profit
growth of about 16% in the holiday quarter, down from 25% a year earlier. 
    The digital payment space has become fiercely competitive, with tech giants including Apple
<AAPL.O> and Google <GOOGL.O> expanding their presence and industry heavyweights like PayPal
<PYPL.O> broadening offerings to retain cautious customers.
    ""The long-term economics of this (Cash App) business remain the biggest point of
uncertainty,"" said Brett Horn, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, noting that its growth
trajectory is ""still in question."" 
    Meanwhile, Block's business-focused Square unit reported gross profit growth of 12% in the
quarter, versus 18% a year earlier. 
    The company is set to shed roughly $8 billion in market value, if losses hold to session
close. 
    At least three brokerages lowered their price target on the stock after results. 
 
    
'NOW OR NEVER' YEAR
    Block expects gross profit to grow by at least 15% year-over-year in 2025, with margins
expanding by around 240 basis points. 
    Analysts view BNPL expansion as a key growth driver for Block, with Jefferies calling 2025 a
""now or never"" year for the company, while Oppenheimer said the full-year outlook for gross
profit growth will ""no doubt be a point of contention for investors.""  
    The BNPL market is projected to surpass $160 billion by 2032, with retailers including
Walmart, Target and Amazon, joining fintech players like Block and PayPal in offering the
service to attract younger, credit-averse shoppers.
    With its quick approval process, easy access, and a revenue model based on fees, BNPL is an
attractive proposition for fintech while traditional banks have been constrained by stricter
regulations, higher risk assessment standards, and a reliance on interest-based credit products.
    Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja said on a post-earnings call that Block expects Cash
App’s growth to accelerate as it scales Afterpay products, which it acquired in January 2022, on
the platform and invests in marketing.
    Oppenheimer analysts said the first quarter will likely be the weakest due to a leap year
and a stronger dollar but the brokerage said it remains optimistic about 2025.

 (Adds background on Tesla capacity, deliveries in paragraphs
5-6, analyst comment about US tariffs in paragraphs 15-16,
detail about Tesla cash in paragraph 17)
       Feb 21 (Reuters) - A high-level Japanese group that
includes a former prime minister has drawn up plans for Tesla
<TSLA.O> to invest in Nissan <7201.T> after the collapse of its
merger talks with Honda <7267.T>, the Financial Times said on
Friday.
    A separate Nikkei newspaper report said Taiwan's Foxconn
<2317.TW> has proposed forming a partnership with Honda with an
ultimate aim of creating a four-way framework that would also
include Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors <7211.T>.
    The Japanese group behind the plans for Tesla to invest in
Nissan hopes the Elon Musk-led company will become a strategic
investor, believing it is keen to acquire Nissan's plants in the
United States, according to the Financial Times.
    The proposal is being led by former Tesla board member
Hiromichi Mizuno with support from ex-premier Yoshihide Suga and
his former aide Hiroto Izumi, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified sources.
    Some analysts, however, are doubtful of Tesla's interest in
acquiring U.S. plants, citing its ample capacity at existing
factories and first decline in yearly deliveries in 2024.
        Tesla said last month it expected the vehicle business
to 
    return to growth
     this year.
  
    Suga's office said it was not aware of a plan to encourage
Tesla to invest in Nissan. Suga stood down as prime minister in
2021 but remains a member of Japan's lower house, representing a
constituency in Nissan's home prefecture of Kanagawa.
    In a social media post, Mizuno said he had ""absolutely no
involvement"" in what was reported in the FT article, adding that
he doubted if Tesla had any interest at all in Nissan factories
given Tesla's unique factory design.
    Nissan declined to comment on the report, while Tesla did
not respond to requests for comment. Reuters was not immediately
able to contact Izumi.
        Matt Britzman, a senior equity analyst at Hargreaves
Lansdown, said there was no value for Tesla in investing in
infrastructure from a legacy carmaker.
    ""Tesla's secret weapon is the novel way its factories have
been designed and optimised for its cars,"" Britzman said.
    Nissan shares closed up 9.6% after the FT report. The
automaker and Honda ended talks to forge a $60-billion car
company last week. Nissan said it will seek new partnerships. 
    According to the FT, some Nissan board members have
suggested Tesla and Apple <AAPL.O> as ideal strategic investors.
    Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
    Acquiring Nissan's U.S. plants might make sense considering
President Donald Trump's plans to apply new tariffs on auto
imports, and separate tariffs on Mexico and Canada, said
Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein.
        ""The cost to build a new auto plant is high, so if Tesla
is able to acquire an existing plant that greatly reduces the
cost,"" he said.
  
    Tesla ended 2024 with $36.56 billion in cash and
equivalents, giving it a large war chest for any deal, although
it has shown little appetite for investing in auto companies.
    Sources have previously told Reuters that Nissan was open to
working with new partners, with the world's largest contract
electronics manufacturer Foxconn seen as one candidate.
    Later on Friday, the Nikkei newspaper reported that through
partnering with Honda, Foxconn aimed to form a broader framework
for cooperation to compete against Tesla and Chinese EV makers.
    Honda declined to comment on the Nikkei report. Foxconn
representatives did not immediately reply to a comment request.
    Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida said last week that Nissan and
Foxconn had not held talks at management level. A day before
Uchida made his remarks, the Taiwanese firm's chairman had said
it would consider taking a stake in Nissan for cooperation.

    By Jonathan Stempel
       Feb 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway
<BRKa.N> on Friday disclosed a new investment in alcoholic
beverages producer Constellation Brands <STZ.N>, and said it has
reduced its holdings in four banks, including Citigroup <C.N>
and Bank of America <BAC.N>.
        In a regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock
holdings as of December 31, Berkshire also disclosed it has
stopped selling shares of Apple <AAPL.O>, which remained its
largest common stock investment at $75.1 billion.
  
        The filing nonetheless suggests that Berkshire remains
concerned about valuations, after selling $133.2 billion of
stock--primarily 490 million Apple shares--between January and
September 2024, and letting its cash stake grow to $325.2
billion.
  
        Berkshire owned $1.24 billion of Constellation stock at
year end, after purchasing 5.62 million shares in the fourth
quarter.
  
        In after-hours trading, Constellation's share price rose
6.7%, reflecting what investors view as Buffett's seal of
approval regardless of whether the revered billionaire investor
personally did the buying.
  
        Constellation did not immediately respond to requests
for comment.
  
        Its beer brands include Corona and Modelo Especial,
which in 2023 surpassed Bud Light as the top-selling beer in the
United States, while its wine portfolio include Meiomi, Robert
Mondavi and Kim Crawford.
  
        Berkshire also owns a small stake in Diageo <DGE.L>,
whose brands include Guinness beer, Johnnie Walker Scotch and
Smirnoff vodka.
  
        To go with the alcohol, Berkshire also invests in
Domino's Pizza <DPZ.O>, and boosted its stake by 86% in the
quarter.
  
        In Friday's filing, Berkshire said it lowered its
Citigroup stake 74% to 14.6 million shares, and its Bank of
America stake, until recently its second-largest common stock
holding, 15% to 680.2 million shares.
  
        Berkshire has reduced its Bank of America stake by
one-third since July, when it owned 1.03 billion shares.
  
        It has also unwound a small portion of the 700 million
Bank of America shares it bought in 2017, when it redeemed $5
billion of preferred stock acquired six years earlier and used
proceeds to exercise warrants at $7.14 per share.
  
        Bank of America shares have since risen more than
sixfold.
  
        During the fourth quarter, Berkshire also reduced its
stakes in Capital One <COF.N> and Brazilian fintech lender Nu
Holdings <NU.N>.
  
        It exited one stock altogether, cosmetics store chain
Ulta Beauty <ULTA.O>, which it owned for less than a year.
  
        Friday's filing does not say which investments are
Buffett's and which are from Berkshire portfolio managers Todd
Combs and Ted Weschler, who typically handle smaller Berkshire
investments.
  
        Berkshire also owns dozens of companies including the
BNSF railroad and Geico car insurance, and its annual report
expected on February 22 will include its year-end financial
results.

    By Carolina Mandl
       BANGALORE/NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - U.S.-based hedge
fund Viking Global built a $526 million-worth new position in
planemaker Boeing <BA.N> in the fourth quarter, with 2.9 million
shares, and roughly doubled bets on JPMorgan Chase, a regulatory
filing showed on Friday.
    Shares in Boeing are up 3.92% year to date, but are still
worth 30% less than its peak in December 2023. The plane maker
has been trying to revive production that was dented last year
by a strike, and an accident that raised concerns about the
safety of its jets.
    In January, Boeing's shares rallied after the company said
it was making progress to stabilize production, despite a $11.8
billion loss.
    Some other investors also placed bets that Boeing's share
price will rise. Soros Fund Management, the family office of
billionaire George Soros, increased its stake in the plane
maker, while macro hedge fund Discovery Capital Management
unveiled a new stake.
    The $45.3 billion equities long/short hedge fund showed a
new stake in carmaker General Motors, with 2.6 million shares
worth $137.4 million.
    
    
    FINANCIALS
    Andreas Halvorsen's hedge fund reinforced bets on
financials, increasing stakes in JPMorgan Chase <JPM.N>, Bank of
America <BAC.N> and Charles Schwab <SCHW.N>.
    JPMorgan's was Viking's biggest stake in dollar amount at
the end of December, worth $1.8 billion, the filing showed. The
fund roughly doubled its stake to 7.5 million shares.
    It also had over $1 billion in positions in Bank of America
and Schwab. 
    The fund's positions were revealed in quarterly securities
filings known as 13Fs. While backward-looking, these snapshots
show what funds owned on the last day of the quarter and are one
of the few ways hedge funds and other institutional investors
have to declare their positions. The filings do not indicate
exact timing of purchases or sales and may not reflect current

       NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Hedge fund giant
Bridgewater Associates added shares of Tesla <TSLA.O> to its
portfolio in the fourth quarter, while it trimmed exposure to
the rest of the ""Magnificent Seven"" group of U.S. tech and
growth stocks, a regulatory filing showed. 
    The firm founded by investor Ray Dalio ended December with a
small stake in Elon Musk's electric carmaker, comprised of
153,589 shares and worth $62 million, according to the filing

    Shares of Tesla are down roughly 13% this year and down more

    The billionaire entrepreneur is heading the Department of
Government Efficiency, which is in charge of cutting waste from
federal agencies.
    Meanwhile, the macro hedge fund made sizeable cuts in the
rest of its Magnificent Seven stocks. It slashed its stake in
Apple <AAPL.O> by 40% to 617,203 shares, and reduced its
position in Amazon <AMZN.O> by almost 35%.
    Cuts in Nvidia <NVDA.O>, Microsoft <MSFT.O>, Meta <META.O>

those positions were still worth hundreds of millions of

British chip firm Arm Holdings <ARM.O> by about 44% and exited
its holdings in Serve Robotics and SoundHound AI in the fourth

    The artificial intelligence chip giant also reported a

    WeRide uses Nvidia's advanced graphics processors and AI

    By Gursimran  Mehar
       Feb 8(Reuters) - Billionaire Elon Musk said that he was
not interested in purchasing TikTok, the popular short-video app
that the United States has been trying to ban over national
security concerns with its Chinese owner ByteDance.
    Musk's comments, made in late January, were released online
Saturday by The WELT Group, a part of the German media company
Axel Springer SE, which hosted a summit, where the Tesla
<TSLA.O> chief joined the conference via video. 
    ""I have not put in a bid for TikTok,"" Musk said a week after
U.S. President Donald Trump said he was open to Musk buying the
ByteDance-owned app if he wanted to do so.
    ""I don't have any plans for what I would do if I had
TikTok,"" Musk said, adding that he does not use the short video
app personally, and was not familiar with the app's format. 
    ""I'm not chomping at the bit to acquire TikTok, I do not
acquire companies in general, it's quite rare,"" Musk said,
adding that his billion-dollar acquisition of social media
platform Twitter, now called X, was unusual. 
    ""I usually build companies from scratch,"" Musk said. 
    The Republican president signed an executive order seeking
to delay the enforcement of a ban on the popular short-video app
that was slated to be shuttered on January 19. 
    ByteDance was given the January deadline to sell the U.S.
assets of TikTok or face a U.S. ban, following lawmakers'
concerns that the app poses national security risks because
China could compel the company to share the data of its U.S.
users. TikTok has denied that it has or ever would share U.S.
user data.
    Apple and Google have not reinstated TikTok to their app
stores since a U.S. law took effect. TikTok said on Friday that
it was allowing U.S. Android users to download and connect to
the app through package kits on its website, in an effort to
circumvent restrictions on the popular platform in the country.
   Trump has said that he was in talks with multiple people over
TikTok's purchase and would likely have a decision on the app's
future this month. It has about 170 million American users.
    This week, the president signed an executive order to create
a sovereign wealth fund within the year, saying it could
potentially buy TikTok.
    ByteDance has previously denied any plans to sell TikTok. 
    Trump saving TikTok represents a reversal in stance from his
first term in office when he unsuccessfully sought to ban the
app over concerns the company was sharing Americans' personal
information with the Chinese government.
    More recently, Trump has said he has ""a warm spot in my
heart for TikTok,"" crediting the app with helping him win over
young voters in the 2024 presidential election. 
    ByteDance and TikTok did not immediately respond to a
request for comment outside regular business hours.

    By Robyn Mak and Katrina Hamlin
       HONG KONG, Feb 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Speed may not
be of the essence when it comes to carmaking M&A. Taiwan's Hon
Hai Precision <2317.TW>, also known as Foxconn, has an
opportunity to swoop in on Nissan Motor <7201.T> now that the
Japanese manufacturer's merger talks with rival Honda Motor 
<7267.T> have stalled. But a closer look suggests troubled
Nissan is not a must-have for boss Young Liu.
    True, the $75 billion company's years-long foray into
electric vehicles has underwhelmed so far. It raced into joint
ventures at home and abroad and even bought a factory in the
U.S. from startup Lordstown Motor in 2022. It also inked an
assembly agreement with another EV darling, Fisker, with plans

    Fierce competition from Chinese brands, slowing demand and a
raft of bankruptcies among EV startups - including both
Lordstown and Fisker - have derailed most of those plans. Last
year, Foxconn's EV strategy chief, Jun Seki, admitted that it
will probably take another five years for its U.S. factory to
reach full production capacity of 350,000 vehicles a year,
though for which brands remains unclear.
    Against this backdrop, Nissan, Seki's former employer, looks
a tempting target. Foxconn founder Terry Gou has long wanted his
firm to compete with consumer brands. Bagging a household name
like Nissan would be a big step up. Moreover, Nissan's annual
production capacity of 4 million vehicles across the U.S., China
and Europe would turbo-charge the Taiwanese group's output.
    Yet Nissan is forecast to log a 70%-plus year-on-year fall
in operating profit in the fiscal year to the end of March 2025,
per analyst estimates gathered on LSEG. Moreover, its forecast
operating profit margin is less than 2%, below Foxconn's
already-uninspiring 3% expected for this year. Crucially, Nissan
is a battery laggard: only 16% of its 2024 sales were electric
or hybrid vehicles.    
    There are other hazards. U.S. President Donald Trump has
threatened tariffs against Canada and Mexico, a key
manufacturing hub for Nissan's U.S. business. And Foxconn's own
M&A track record does not inspire confidence either: in 2016, it
splashed out $3.5 billion for control of Japan's Sharp <6753.T>.
The Tokyo-traded stock has since delivered total returns of
negative 16% compared with a near-190% gain for the Nikkei 225
Index <.N225> over the same period. Liu has reason to drive
carefully this time around.

       HONG KONG, Feb 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Speed may not
be of the essence when it comes to carmaking M&A. Taiwan's Hon
Hai Precision <2317.TW>, also known as Foxconn, has an
opportunity to swoop in on Nissan Motor <7201.T> now that the
Japanese manufacturer's merger talks with rival Honda Motor 
<7267.T> have stalled. But a closer look suggests troubled
Nissan is not a must-have for boss Young Liu.
    True, the $75 billion company's years-long foray into
electric vehicles has underwhelmed so far. It raced into joint
ventures at home and abroad and even bought a factory in the
U.S. from startup Lordstown Motor in 2022. It also inked an
assembly agreement with another EV darling, Fisker, with plans
to open another factory stateside. Liu's ambition was to

paragraph 2)
       Jan 24 (Reuters) - Tata Electronics said on Friday it
has bought a 60% stake in Taiwanese contract manufacturer
Pegatron's India unit that operates an iPhone plant, beefing up
the Tata group firm's position as an Apple supplier in a fast
growing market.
    The stake acquisition in Pegatron Technology India is for
Apple Inc's <AAPL.O> iPhone plant near the southern city of
Chennai, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
    Tata Electronics and Pegatron <4938.TW> did not immediately
respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
    Tata Electronics did not reveal financial terms of the deal.
        The company will now have two plants in the southern
state of Tamil Nadu and one in neighboring Karnataka, which it 
    took over
     from Taiwan's Wistron <3231.TW> last year.
  
    Apple is increasingly looking to diversify its supply chain
beyond China amid geopolitical tensions between Beijing and
Washington. 
    Last April, Reuters reported that Pegatron had the backing
of Apple and was in advanced talks to sell its only iPhone plant
in India to Tata as the Taiwanese firm looked to scale back its
partnership with Apple.
    Tata, one of the largest conglomerates in India, has been
expanding into iPhone manufacturing, rivaling Foxconn <2317.TW>,
the only other iPhone contract manufacturer operating in India.
    India's competition regulator earlier in January approved
Tata Electronics' plan to buy a stake in Pegatron Technology
India.

    By Andrew Chung, John Kruzel and David Shepardson
       WASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - 
    TikTok warned late Friday it will go dark in the United
States on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration
provides assurances to companies like Apple and Google that they
will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect.
  
    The statement came hours after the Supreme Court upheld a
law banning TikTok in the United States on national security
grounds if its Chinese parent company ByteDance does not sell
it, putting the popular short-video app on track to go dark in
just two days. 
    The court's 9-0 decision throws the social media platform -
and its 170 million American users - into limbo, and its fate in
the hands of Donald Trump, who has vowed to rescue TikTok after
returning to the presidency on Monday.
        ""Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a
definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service
providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be
forced to go dark on January 19,"" the company said.
  
        The White House declined to comment.
  
        Apple <AAPL.O>, Alphabet's <GOOGL.O> Google, Oracle
<ORCL.N> and others could face massive fines if they continue to
provide services to TikTok after the ban takes effect.
  
    The law was passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in
Congress last year and signed by Biden, though a growing chorus
of lawmakers who voted for it are now seeking to keep TikTok
operating in the United States.
    TikTok, ByteDance and some of the app's users challenged the
law, but the Supreme Court decided that it did not violate the
U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protection against
government abridgment of free speech as they had argued.
    ByteDance has done little to divest of TikTok by the Sunday
deadline set under the law. But the app's shutdown might be
brief. Trump, who in 2020 had tried to ban TikTok, has said he
plans to take action to save the app. 
    ""My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant
future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay
tuned!"" Trump said in a social media post. 
    TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend Trump's second
inauguration on Monday in Washington.
    Trump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed
TikTok in a phone call on Friday.     
    
    'FOREIGN ADVERSARY CONTROL'
    For years TikTok's Chinese ownership has raised concerns
among U.S. leaders, and the TikTok fight has unfolded at a time
of rising trade tensions between the world's two biggest
economies.
    Lawmakers and Biden's administration have said China could
use TikTok to amass data on millions of Americans for
harassment, recruitment and espionage.
    ""TikTok's scale and susceptibility to foreign adversary
control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the
platform collects, justify differential treatment to address the
government's national security concerns,"" the Supreme Court said
in the unsigned opinion.
    TikTok has become one of the most prominent social media
platforms in the U.S., particularly among young people who use
it for short-form videos, including many who use it as a
platform for small businesses. 
    Some users reacted with shock that the ban could actually
happen. 
    ""Oh my god, I'm speechless,"" said Lourd Asprec, 21, of
Houston, who has amassed 16.3 million followers on TikTok and
makes an estimated $80,000 a year from the platform. ""I don't
even care about China stealing my data. They can take all my
data from me. Like, if anything, I'll go to China myself and
give them my data.""
    The company's powerful algorithm, its main asset, feeds
individual users short videos tailored to their liking. The
platform presents a vast collection of user-submitted videos,
that can be viewed with a smart phone app or on the internet. 
    As the Jan. 19 deadline approached, millions of users jumped
to other Chinese-owned apps like RedNote, finding they had to
decipher its all-Mandarin platform to kickstart their feeds. 
    ""China is adapting in real-time to the ruling,"" said Craig
Singleton, a China expert at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies think tank, which submitted a brief in the case
against TikTok. ""Beijing isn't just building apps; it's building
a discourse power ecosystem to shape global narratives and
influence societies.""
    Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement the
ruling affirmed that the law protects U.S. national security.
    ""Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to
millions of Americans' sensitive data,"" Garland added.
    
    WHAT HAPPENS NEXT    
    The Biden administration has emphasized that TikTok could
continue operating if it is freed from China's control. The
White House said on Friday that Biden will not take any action
to save TikTok.
    Biden has not formally invoked a 90-day delay in the
deadline as allowed by the law.
    ""This decision’s going to be made by the next president
anyway,"" Biden told reporters.
    The law bars providing certain services to TikTok and other
foreign adversary-controlled apps including by offering it
through app stores such as Apple and Google.
    Google declined to comment on Friday. Apple and Oracle did
not respond to requests for comment.
    White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said action
to implement the law ""must fall to the next administration""
while the Justice Department said ""implementing and ensuring
compliance with the law after it goes into effect on January 19
— will be a process that plays out over time.""
    TikTok said those statements ""have failed to provide the
necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that
are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170
million Americans.""
    A viable buyer could still emerge, or Trump could invoke a
law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act,
stating that keeping TikTok is beneficial for national security.
    Only one notable bidder has emerged so far - Frank McCourt,
former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, who said
he believes TikTok is worth about $20 billion without its
algorithm. 
    ""Beijing needs TikTok more than Washington does,"" said
Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow and expert in U.S.-China
relations at the Hudson Institute think tank.
    ""With that leverage, Trump has a better chance of getting
what he wants: TikTok’s continued operation in America without
any national security threats.""

    By Greg Bensinger
       Jan 17 (Reuters) - TikTok is entering its final hours in
the U.S. ahead of a potential ban effective on Sunday, prompting
howls of protest from devoted users of the beloved
video-streaming app.
    Chelsea Rossi could not be happier.
    The part-time real estate agent from Albany, New York, said
she spends a minimum of two hours on the app each day flipping
through short videos covering anything from beauty tips to
recipes.
    ""It’s horrific,"" said the 23-year-old. ""Honestly, I am happy
about the ban. I feel like I don’t remember what life was like
before TikTok.""
    Owned by China’s ByteDance, the app faces a complete U.S.
ban on Sunday unless it finds a non-Chinese buyer. The planned
shutdown stems from an April law signed by President Joe Biden
that will bar new downloads on Apple <AAPL.O> or Google
<GOOGL.O> app stores and prohibit companies from providing
services that enable the app.
    The U.S. Supreme Court refused to rescue TikTok on Friday
from the law in a major blow to a platform used by nearly half
of Americans.
    Lawmakers allege it is a surveillance and propaganda machine
camouflaged in banal dancing, prank and cooking videos served
daily to some 170 million U.S. users. TikTok has repeatedly
denied this. 
    Although some key U.S. officials are attempting to delay a
shutdown, some users are hopeful the highly addictive app
disappears forever.
    Jennifer Whims, of Snohomish County, Washington, said she
has uninstalled the app multiple times since discovering it
years ago - only to reinstall it days later.
    ""It’s become too much of a part of my life,” said Whims, 32,
whose daily diet of five hours of TikTok videos includes tarot
readings and self-help instruction. ""I’ll be relieved when the
ban is in effect.""
    The app has grown into a cultural phenomenon, minting a
smattering of influencers and new celebrities whose reach
has proven irresistible to advertisers paying them to peddle
products such as Momofuku ramen noodles and Birkenstock knockoff
sandals in TikTok's online store. 
    Musicians such as Lil Nas X have catapulted to fame in part
because of TikTok’s reach, while book enthusiasts on the app
have lifted authors such as Colleen Hoover to the top of
bestseller lists.
     
 ALGORITHM MAKES APP ADDICTIVE
TikTok’s secret sauce is its algorithm, which adapts to users’
behavior, showing more of some videos and less of others based
on factors such as how long they watch and whether they comment
or click a digital heart to ""like” content. Meta's <META.O>
Facebook and Google's YouTube, among others, are also designed
to enthrall users, keeping them pinned to their phones. 
    Yet the TikTok algorithm makes the app particularly
addictive, users say, rendering it nearly impossible to watch
just one or a handful of videos in a single sitting. And the
more one- to three-minute videos users consume, the better the
algorithm adapts to make it even more irresistible. 
    ""There’s definitely a dark side to it,"" said Andrew
Coleburn, 30, a software engineer in New York City. ""I can
almost feel it decreasing my attention span.""
    Research shows TikTok is particularly well-designed to
encourage overuse and court documents suggest TikTok knew it
could become habit-forming. Thirteen states and the District of
Columbia sued the company, pointing in part to its addictive
qualities. The company has pushed back against those allegations
and notes it has user controls, particularly for teens. 
    Coleburn and others say they prefer TikTok to other
video-streaming sites such as Instagram Reels.
    Like Whims, he has taken measures to curb his use, including
setting a one-hour daily time limit on using TikTok on his
phone. “I blow past that all the time,"" Coleburn said.   
    The potential ban has sparked free-speech concerns and
worries about government overreach. President-elect Donald Trump
and a growing list of U.S. officials have vowed to intervene to
spare the app from dissolution in the U.S. but it is unclear
whether Trump has the authority to do so.
    Interior designer Abigail Green of Columbus, Ohio, said she
will be happy if a ban gets her off TikTok. At her peak usage,
she clocked four hours on the app each day and purchased a lip
stain she had seen touted on TikTok, though it did not last all
day as promised. 
    Green, 23, who has posted some of her own content on TikTok,
such as displays of her thrift-store purchases, said the app’s
addictive qualities were dangerous because she could ""scroll for
hours and hours."" 
    ""I had to delete the app a few times to detox,"" said Green,
who likens the demise of TikTok as akin to taking away a
smoker’s pack of cigarettes.
    With his newfound time following TikTok’s domestic shutdown,
Coleburn plans to read more books. “I’ve found some new books to
read recently that I never would have otherwise,” he said. 
    Where? On TikTok.

 (Updates Jan. 16 story to add Chinese foreign ministry comment
in paragraphs 6-7)
    By Supantha Mukherjee and Foo Yun Chee
       STOCKHOLM/BRUSSELS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - TikTok, Shein,
Xiaomi <1810.HK> and three other Chinese companies were named in
a privacy complaint filed on Thursday by Austrian advocacy group
Noyb, which alleged the firms were unlawfully sending European
Union user data to China. 
    Noyb is known for filing complaints against American
companies such as Apple <AAPL.O>, Alphabet <GOOGL.O> and Meta
<META.O>, leading to several investigations and billions of
dollars in fines.
    Vienna-based Noyb (None Of Your Business) said this was its
first complaint against Chinese firms.
    Noyb has filed six complaints in Greece, Netherlands,
Belgium, Italy and Austria seeking to suspend data transfers to
China and is calling for fines that can reach up to 4% of a
firm's global revenue. 
    Noyb said Alibaba's <9988.HK> e-commerce site AliExpress,
retailer Shein, TikTok and phone maker Xiaomi admit to sending
Europeans’ personal data to China, citing transparency reports
and other documents, while retailer Temu and Tencent's <0700.HK>
messenger app WeChat transfer data to undisclosed ""third
countries"", likely China.
    The Chinese government ""has never and will never"" ask
enterprises or individuals to collect or provide data
information and intelligence located in foreign countries for
the Chinese government in a manner that violates local laws, its
foreign ministry said on Friday.
    Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a regular news
briefing that China attaches great importance to and protects
data privacy and security in accordance with the law.
    A Xiaomi spokesperson said the company was examining the
allegations and would fully cooperate with authorities to
resolve the matter if they approach the company due to this
complaint.
    Other companies did not immediately respond to requests for
comment.
    Under the European Union's General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) privacy regime, data transfers outside the EU
are only allowed if the destination country doesn't undermine
the protection of data.    
    ""Given that China is an authoritarian surveillance state, it
is crystal clear that China doesn't offer the same level of data
protection as the EU,"" said Kleanthi Sardeli, a data protection
lawyer at Noyb. ""Transferring Europeans’ personal data is
clearly unlawful – and must be terminated immediately.""    
    Chinese companies, notably ByteDance-owned TikTok, have been
facing off with regulators in various countries. TikTok is
planning to shut its app for U.S. users from Sunday, when a
federal ban on the social media app is due to come into effect.
    The European Commission is also investigating TikTok over
its suspected failure to limit election interference, notably in
the Romanian presidential vote in November.

       Jan 16 (Reuters) - Two technology trade groups sued the
U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Thursday to block a
new rule giving the regulator supervisory authority over payment
apps and digital wallets from large non-banks.
    NetChoice and TechNet said Congress did not give the CFPB
free rein to aggressively, arbitrarily and capriciously police
large non-banks offering consumer financial services through
such products as Apple Wallet <AAPL.O>, Google Pay <GOOGL.O> and
Venmo.
    The trade groups also said the CFPB identified no consumer
risks or gaps in regulatory oversight that justified the rule,
which covers companies that process at least 50 million
transactions annually, and more than 13 billion overall.
    According to the complaint filed in Washington, D.C.,
federal court, ""The bureau failed to show what consumer risks
the rule was even meant to alleviate in its haste to dream up a
problem in search of a solution.""
    The CFPB had no immediate comment on the lawsuit.
    In announcing the final rule on Nov. 21, the CFPB said it
would help give consumers who use big technology companies for
processing payments the same protections against fraud, privacy
violations and account closures they enjoy at banks.
    CFPB director Rohit Chopra said at the time that digital
payments ""have gone from novelty to necessity and our oversight
must reflect this reality.""
    NetChoice director of litigation Chris Marchese in a
statement on Thursday called the rule an ""unlawful power grab""
that could stifle innovation, reduce competition and raise
prices.
    Carl Holshouser, a TechNet executive vice president, in a
separate statement said that the rule could also subject digital
payment service providers to oversight of tax payments and other
products that go beyond the CFPB's mission.
    It is unclear whether Republican President-elect Donald
Trump's administration or the Republican-controlled Congress
might try to change or eliminate the rule, amid expectations
they will try to reduce the CFPB's supervisory authority.
    The case is TechNet et al v CFPB et al, U.S. District Court,
District of Columbia, No. 25-00118.

    By Nupur Anand
       NEW YORK, Jan 15 - Apple <AAPL.O> is in talks with
Barclays <BARC.L> to replace Goldman Sachs <GS.N> as the tech
giant's credit card partner, said two sources familiar with the
matter, as the Wall Street giant steps back from its consumer
finance ambitions.
    Credit card issuer Synchrony Financial <SYF.N> is also in
discussions with Apple about the card partnership, the first
source said. Both sources declined to be identified discussing
private talks.
    Several financial firms are vying to replace Goldman, which
launched the credit card with Apple in 2019, the sources said.
While other lenders are tempted by working with Apple, one of
the world's most recognizable brands, they also viewed the
original deal terms as risky and unprofitable, sources told
Reuters in December 2023. 
    Negotiations between Apple and Barclays have been ongoing
for several months, but it may still take months to strike a
deal, the first source said. 
    JPMorgan Chase <JPM.N> has also been in talks with Apple
about the business since last year, Reuters reported previously.
    Representatives for Apple, Goldman, Barclays and JPMorgan
declined to comment. Synchrony did not immediately respond to a
request for comment. 
    Goldman's credit card deal with Apple lasts until 2030, but
the partnership may end sooner than that, Goldman CEO David
Solomon told analysts on an earnings call on Wednesday.
    In 2024, Goldman transferred its General Motors <GM.N>
credit card business to Barclays that allows customers to earn
and redeem reward points on new Buicks, Cadillacs and other GM
cars, including electric vehicles. The deal enabled Barclays to
expand its card footprint in the U.S.
    Goldman entered the consumer business nearly a decade ago,
aiming to broaden its revenue beyond its traditional mainstays
of trading and investment banking. By late 2022, the Wall Street
powerhouse decided to scale down its retail ambitions after
setting aside billions of dollars to cover potential losses in
the business.

    By David Shepardson
       WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Two Democratic lawmakers
on Monday urged Congress and President Joe Biden to extend a
Jan. 19 deadline for China-based ByteDance to sell the U.S.
assets of TikTok or face a U.S. ban.
    The Supreme Court held arguments Friday on Tiktok and
ByteDance's challenge to the law. A lawyer for the companies,
Noel Francisco, said it would be impossible to complete a sale
by next week's deadline.
    He said if banned, the the short video app used by 170
million Americans would quickly go dark and ""essentially the
platform shuts down.""
    Biden could extend the deadline by 90 days if he certifies
ByteDance is making substantial progress toward a divestiture
but it is unlikely ByteDance could meet that standard.
    Senator Edward Markey said he planned to introduce
legislation to delay the deadline by which ByteDance must sell
TikTok or face a ban by an additional 270 days.
    ""A ban would dismantle a one-of-a-kind informational and
cultural ecosystem, silencing millions in the process,"" Markey
said Monday. 
    ""A TikTok ban would impose serious consequences on millions
of Americans who depend on the app for social connections and
their economic livelihood. We cannot allow that to happen.""
    President-elect Donald Trump has asked the court to delay
implementation of the law, arguing he should have time after
taking office on Jan. 20 to pursue a ""political resolution"" to
the issue.
    Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat, on Monday urged Biden
and Trump ""to put a pause on this ban so 170 million Americans
don't lose their free speech. Millions of Americans' livelihood
will be ended if this ban takes place.""
    If the court does not block the law by Sunday, new downloads
of TikTok on Apple <AAPL.O> or Google <GOOGL.O> app stores would
be banned but existing users could continue to access the app
for some period. Services would degrade and eventually stop
working as companies will be barred from providing support.    
    The White House did not immediately comment.

    By Tom Hals
       WILMINGTON, Delaware, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Internal
Qualcomm <QCOM.O> documents showed the chip firm estimated it
could eventually save as much as $1.4 billion a year on payments
to Arm <O9Ty.F> <ARM.O> by purchasing a little-known startup in
2021, according to evidence shown at a trial on Wednesday.
    The projection surfaced while Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon
was testifying to a jury in Delaware federal court about his
firm's rationale for purchasing Nuvia for $1.4 billion in 2021.
    ""It justified the acquisition,"" he said of the potential
savings on royalty payments to Arm.
    The chip firm's CEO was testifying as part of a trial to
resolve claims that Arm can force Qualcomm to destroy the
technology it acquired because Arm never consented to the
transfer of Nuvia's license agreements.
    Qualcomm has used the technology and talent it acquired from
Nuvia to spearhead its push into the PC market, where it is
hoping to help Microsoft's <MSFT.O> Windows ecosystem claw back
market share lost to Apple <AAPL.O> in recent years.
    Amon's testimony on Wednesday described how relations
between Arm and Qualcomm, Arm's biggest customer, began to
curdle years before the court dispute between the two firms. In
the 2010s, Qualcomm stopped designing its own computing cores
and decided to purchase designs off the shelf from Arm.
    Near the end of the decade, Qualcomm believed the technology
it was buying from Arm was causing it to fall behind Apple in
the smartphone market at the same time Amon saw an opportunity
to challenge Intel <INTC.O> in the laptop market. But Qualcomm
had no viable plan for developing its own computing cores to
lessen its dependence on Arm, Amon testified.
    That changed when a team of ex-Apple engineers who had
helped design the iPhone maker's flagship chips founded their
own startup in 2019 called Nuvia. After trying without success
to persuade Nuvia to develop computing cores for Qualcomm, Amon
decided the best path was to buy the young company.
    Qualcomm faced a challenge in justifying the deal. While
Nuvia had designs and sought-after talent, it lacked a finished
product and was focused on the server market, not laptops and
mobile devices.
    To justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars or more
for the firm, Amon told Qualcomm's board that the company could
eventually save as much as $1.4 billion per year on payments to
Arm by switching away from Arm's computing core designs to those
based on work by Nuvia and its team.
    The $1.4 billion a year of theoretical savings was based on
the expectation that Qualcomm would enter a massive new market
for PC chips that would require similarly massive payments to
Arm for the use of its technology.
    That figure is far higher than the $50 million reduction in
revenue from Qualcomm that Arm executives feared when the Nuvia
deal was announced.
    Analysts have estimated that Qualcomm currently pays Arm
about $300 million a year, though that figure does not take into
account possible Qualcomm expansions into new markets.
    Amon said he believed Qualcomm would be free to start using
Nuvia's technology because both Nuvia and Qualcomm had their own
licenses to build computing cores that would be compatible with
Arm's underlying computer architecture.
    Arm's executives objected and eventually terminated Nuvia's
license, demanding that Qualcomm destroy all Nuvia technology
that was developed with it.
    Closing arguments in the trial are expected on Thursday.

 (Adds fund declining to comment in paragraph 4)
       OSLO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The value of Norway's sovereign
wealth fund, the world's largest, rose to a record 20 trillion
crowns ($1.80 trillion) on Friday, doubling its value in just
five years as oil and gas revenue flowed in and stock markets
rose.
    Built since 1996 as rainy-day savings, the fund owns about
1.5% of all listed stocks globally and has grown to almost four
times the size of Norway's annual gross domestic product, far
exceeding original projections.
    The fund's value was comparable in size to the annual GDP of
Australia, a country with five times the population of Norway.
    The fund declined to comment.
    Norges Bank Investment Management, which operates the fund,
invests some 70% of assets in global stocks, about 25% in bonds
and the rest in real estate and renewable energy plants, with
most of its portfolio tracking international market indexes.
    Its current value corresponds to about $321,000 for every
man, woman and child living in the country of 5.6 million
people.
    Its single biggest holding was in U.S. government bonds,
amounting to $136 billion or 7.5% of the fund at June 30, while
the top corporate holdings were Microsoft Corp <MSFT.O> with $41
billion, Apple Inc <AAPL.O>with $35 billion and Nvidia <NVDA.O>
at $34 billion.
    The fund hit the 10 trillion crowns milestone in October
2019, and was boosted further in the following years by global
economic stimulus during the COVID pandemic and by soaring
natural gas prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
    The strength of the U.S. dollar and the euro also boosted
the value of the fund as measured in Norwegian crowns.

 (Updates prices in second paragraph)
       Dec 5 (Reuters) - Bitcoin catapulted above $100,000 for
the first time on Thursday, a milestone hailed even by sceptics
as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a
friendly U.S. administration to cement the place of
cryptocurrencies in financial markets.
    Once it broke $100,000 in Thursday's Asian morning, boosted
by U.S. President-elect Trump's nomination of pro-crypto Paul
Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was
soon at an all-time high of $103,649. It last fetched $98,803,
up 0.95% on the day <BTC=>.
    The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost
doubled over the year so far to hit a record over $3.8 trillion,
according to data provider CoinGecko. By comparison, Apple
<AAPL.O> alone is worth about $3.7 trillion.
    Bitcoin's march from the libertarian fringe to Wall Street
has minted millionaires, a new asset class and popularised the
concept of ""decentralised finance"" in a volatile and often
controversial period since its creation 16 years ago.
    Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up
more than 50% in the four weeks since Donald Trump's sweeping
election victory, which also saw a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers
being elected to Congress.
    ""CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!!
Together, we will Make America Great Again!"" Trump said on Truth
Social, his social media network, on Thursday.
    ""We're witnessing a paradigm shift,"" said Mike Novogratz,
founder and CEO of U.S. crypto firm Galaxy Digital.
    ""Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the
brink of entering the financial mainstream - this momentum is
fuelled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation
and payments, and a clearer regulatory path.""
     Trump - who once labelled crypto a scam - embraced digital
assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States
the ""crypto capital of the planet"" and to accumulate a national
stockpile of bitcoin.
    ""We were trading basically sideways for about seven months,
then immediately after Nov. 5, U.S. investors resumed buying
hand-over-fist,"" said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric,
a Miami digital assets hedge fund. 
    Bitcoin's proponents cheered Trump's nomination of Atkins to
the SEC.
    A former SEC commissioner, Atkins has been involved in
crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to
""develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading
platforms,"" and the Chamber of Digital Commerce.
    ""Atkins will offer a new perspective, anchored by a deep
understanding of the digital asset ecosystem,"" said Blockchain
Association CEO Kristin Smith.
    ""We look forward to working with him ... and ushering in –
together – a new wave of American crypto innovation.""
    A slew of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and
Circle are also jostling for a seat on Trump's promised crypto
advisory council.
    
    PART OF THE LANDSCAPE
    Bitcoin has proven a survivor through precipitous downturns.
    Its move into six-figure territory is a remarkable comeback
from a dip below $16,000 in 2022 when the industry was reeling
from the collapse of the FTX exchange. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried
was subsequently jailed.
    Analysts say the growing embrace of bitcoin by big investors
this year has been a driving force behind the record-breaking
rally.
    U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds were approved in
January and have been a conduit for large-scale buying, with
more than $4 billion streaming into these funds since the
election.
    ""Roughly 3% of the total supply of bitcoins that will ever
exist have been purchased in 2024 by institutional money,"" said
Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at
Standard Chartered.
    ""Digital assets, as an asset class, is becoming normalised,""
he said.
    It is already becoming increasingly financialised, with the
launch of bitcoin futures <BTCc1> in 2017 and a strong debut for
options on BlackRock's ETF <IBIT.O> in November.
    Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin
price, with shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings <MARA.O> and
exchange operator Coinbase <COIN.O> each up around 65% in
November.
    Software firm Microstrategy <MSTO.O>, which has repeatedly
raised funds to buy bitcoin and held an aggregate of about
402,100 bitcoins as of Dec. 1, has gained around 540% this year.
    
    Trump himself unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty
Financial, in September, although details have been scarce and
billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent
of cryptocurrencies.
    Some say the asset remains a speculative or investment
vehicle and not an instrument for payments.
    On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell likened
bitcoin to gold, “only it's virtual, it's digital.""
    ""People are not using it as a form of payment, or as a store
of value. It's highly volatile, it’s not a competitor for the
dollar.""
    While earlier big bitcoin rallies have been followed by
significant pullbacks, its wider adoption now may help tamp down
volatility, analysts said.
    ""That is not to say that there will not be 30-50% drawdowns
over time, but my base case is that the nature of the drawdowns
will be less severe than what we saw in the last bear market,"" 
Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat Global
Advisors, said.
    ""Passive flows into ETFs, a liquid options market, corporate
treasury adoption, and nation state adoption will likely play a
large role in dampening volatility,"" Farrell said.
    
    'WHO CAN PROHIBIT IT'    
    Cryptocurrencies have been criticised for their massive
energy consumption and use in crime around the world, and the
underlying technology is far from delivering a revolution in the
way money moves around the globe.
    The U.S. and Britain announced on Wednesday they had
disrupted what they described as a global money laundering ring
which used cryptocurrency to help rich Russians to evade
sanctions and launder cash for drug traffickers.
    Although calculations vary, the Cambridge University Centre
for Alternative Finance estimates bitcoin uses around the same
amount of electricity each year as Poland or South Africa.
    Still, as Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out at an
investment conference on Wednesday: ""Who can prohibit it? No
one."" And its longevity is perhaps testament to a degree of
resilience.
    ""As time goes by it's proving itself as part of the
financial landscape,"" said Shane Oliver, chief economist and
head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney.
    ""I find it very hard to value it ... it's anyone's guess.
But it does have a momentum aspect to it and at the moment the
momentum is up.""

 (Adds Shein's comment in paragraph 11)
    By Phuong Nguyen and Khanh Vu
       HANOI, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Chinese online retailers Temu
and Shein have suspended their operations in Vietnam as the
companies work to register their e-commerce services with the
Southeast Asian nation's authorities, the two companies said on
Thursday.
    The Vietnamese government and domestic businesses have
voiced concern about the impact of deep discounting by Chinese
online platforms, with the trade ministry saying it was also
worried about potential sale of counterfeits.
    Last month, Vietnam told Shein and Temu to register with the
government by the end of November or face the blocking of
internet domains and a halt in use of their apps.
    Temu, owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings
<PDD.O>, started allowing shoppers from Vietnam in October,
while fast fashion retailer Shein has been selling into Vietnam
for at least two years. 
    Vietnam's trade ministry said on Thursday it had ordered
Temu to suspend operations in the country after it missed the
business registration deadline.
    ""Temu operations will be temporarily suspended until it
completes the registration procedure,"" the ministry said in a
statement.
    ""The platform has submitted an application for e-commerce
service activities in Vietnam which is under authorities'
review.""            
    The ministry did not say how long the suspension would last,
nor what steps Temu must take before it is lifted.
    On Thursday, Vietnamese-language options were missing from
Temu's website when accessed from Vietnam.
    ""Temu is working with the Vietnam E-commerce and Digital
Economy Agency and the Ministry of Industry and Trade to
register its provision of e-commerce services in Vietnam,"" the
company said in a notice on the website. 
    In response to a Reuters' email request for comment, Temu
said it had submitted all documents required for the
registration, but gave no timeframe for resuming operations. 
    It is not clear if the authorities also halted Shein's
operations, but its Vietnamese website was unavailable, with the
company saying it was working with the trade ministry to
register services.
    ""Shein is committed to complying with the laws and
regulations of the countries we operate in,"" Shein said in an
emailed statement, adding that while its Vietnamese website was
temporarily unavailable, customers in Vietnam could still shop
at its international platform.
    The ministry did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.  
    Temu has also stumbled in Indonesia, where regulators have
asked Alphabet's Google <GOOGL.O> and Apple <AAPL.O> to block it
in app stores in the country to protect small merchants.
    Last week, Vietnam's parliament approved legal changes to
require payment of value-added tax (VAT) by local operators of
foreign e-commerce platforms and urged the scrapping of a tax
exemption for low-cost imported goods.
    At the time, the finance ministry said it had begun the
process to scrap the tax break.
    The change spells a blow for the foreign-dominated
e-commerce industry, which has benefited since 2010 from a VAT
exemption and rules allowing it to avoid duties on imports worth
less than 1 million dong ($40).

    By David Shepardson
       WASHINGTON, March 3 (Reuters) - Democratic Senator
Richard Blumenthal on Monday asked U.S. Secretary of State Marco
Rubio to answer questions about a reported plan to spend $400
million to purchase armored versions of Tesla <TSLA.O>
Cybertrucks to transport diplomats.
    The State Department said Monday the contract was planned
during the Biden administration and the Trump administration
canceled it. But the senator, who is the top Democrat on a
Senate investigations subcommittee, said that account has been
questioned.
    ""The question has been raised whether, after significant
public blowback, the Trump Administration created and backdated
government documents to make it appear that the idea to spend
$400 million in taxpayer money on Tesla Cybertrucks originated
with the previous administration,"" Blumenthal wrote.
    Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a close adviser to Trump and help
lead an effort to drastically shrink the federal government and
cut numerous government contracts.
    Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The State Department told Reuters Monday under President Joe
Biden it was asked ""to explore interest from private companies
to produce armored electric vehicles"" and said in response to a
request for information in May 2024 only Tesla expressed
interest.
     ""As a next step in that process, an official solicitation
would be sent out to vehicle manufacturers to bid. However, the
solicitation is on hold and there are no current plans to issue
it,"" the department said, declining to answer questions raised
by Blumenthal.
  
    Blumenthal said if the State Department sought to backdate a
document it would raise serious questions. 
    ""If that occurred, the Trump administration not only
recognizes the tremendous conflicts of interest inherent in Mr.
Musk’s dual roles, but is also taking active steps to hide the
fact that it is ensuring that Mr. Musk’s position is benefiting
his companies,"" Blumenthal wrote.
Other questions have been raised about other potential conflicts
of interest for Musk, including at the Federal Aviation
Administration over a $2.4 billion telecommunications contract
with Verizon and the potential that the contract could be given
to Musk's Starlink satellite telecommunications company, which
is part of SpaceX.

       NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main stock
indexes slipped on Monday after President Donald Trump announced
the start of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and after data
showed a slight dip in U.S. manufacturing.
    Stocks slipped after an ISM survey and extended losses after
Trump said 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico will go into effect
on Tuesday with reciprocal tariffs starting April 2. He said the
North American countries had ""no room left"" to avert the
tariffs.
    The ISM survey showed manufacturing PMI slipped to 50.3 last
month from 50.9 in January, while the forward-looking new orders
index contracted to 48.6 in February from 55.1 in January. The
dip in the PMI mirrored declines in other sentiment measures as
investors worried about tariffs. 
    ""I think it's just more of a continuation of a string of bad
economic news that tends to put a little bit of a dampener on
the optimism that we saw from the fourth quarter earnings that
were getting released, which were pretty good,"" said James St.
Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management
in Santa Monica, California.
    ""You've got a lot of policy uncertainty from Trump.
Certainly layoffs are part of that but also the trade policy. I
think that's all working against the positive sentiment forcing
that sort of glass-half-full mentality into a back seat position
and bringing out some of the bearish glass-half-empty mindset
that comes and goes.""    
    According to preliminary data, the S&P 500
<.SPX> lost 104.19 points, or 1.75%, to end at 5,850.31 points,
while the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> lost 497.09 points, or 2.64%,
to 18,350.19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
<.DJI> fell 643.61 points, or 1.47%, to 43,197.30.
    Recent reports of softening consumer demand have spurred
fears of an economic slowdown and higher inflation. Trump has
threatened that an extra 10% duty on imports from China will
also take effect on Tuesday, which could spark retaliation from
Beijing.
    
    U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies fell, with Nio
<NIO.N> and JD.com <JD.O> off about 6% and 1%, respectively. 
    Worries about sticky inflation have made the Federal Reserve
more cautious on interest rate cuts, but this week's employment
and business activity data could change the central bank's view.
    Traders have been betting on at least two interest rate cuts
of 25 basis point each from the Fed by December, according to
data compiled by LSEG.
    Tesla <TSLA.O> erased early gains. Morgan Stanley had
reinstated the stock as ""top pick"" among U.S. autos. 
    Chipmaker Intel <INTC.O> closed lower, erasing gains that
came in early trade after a report that chip designers Nvidia
<NVDA.O> and Broadcom <AVGO.O> were running manufacturing tests
with the company.

 (Adds Volkswagen CEO in paragraph 10)
    By Philip Blenkinsop
       BRUSSELS, March 3 (Reuters) - The European Commission
yielded to pressure from European automakers on Monday by giving
them three years, rather than only one, to meet new CO2 emission
targets for their cars and vans.
    The EU significantly lowered its cap on automotive carbon
dioxide emissions this year, meaning at least one-fifth of all
sales by most car companies must be electric vehicles (EVs) to
avoid heavy fines. The ultimate goal is for zero emissions in
2035.
    Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said after meeting
auto sector executives, unions and campaign groups on Monday
that the EU executive would propose later this month allowing
compliance over three years, rather than in 2025 alone.
    Meeting the targets, and avoiding related fines, depends on
selling more electric vehicles, a segment where European
carmakers lag Chinese and U.S. rivals.
    Shares in European automakers, including Volkswagen
<VOWG_p.DE>, Renault <RENA.PA>, BMW <BMWG.DE> and Mercedes-Benz
<MBGn.DE> rose by between 1.5% and 4% after von der Leyen's
comments.
    ""The targets stay the same. They have to fulfil the targets,
but it means more breathing space for industry,"" von der Leyen
told a news conference, adding the proposal will still require
approval from EU governments and the European Parliament.
    Compliance would now be based on a carmaker's average
emissions over the period 2025-2027.
        EU carmakers, which have been hit by falling demand and
factory closures, and are now bracing for U.S. tariffs, had
urged the Commission to grant relief from fines they say could
rise to 15 billion euros ($15.7 billion) for 2025.
    
    CAR SECTOR SAVED OR LEFT BEHIND?
    Italy and the Czech Republic, which had pushed for an easing
of penalties, welcomed the proposal. Italian Industry Minister
Adolfo Urso said it meant the European car industry had been
saved, though Czech Transport Minister Martin Kupka said his
country would push for a five-year extension.
        Oliver Blume, CEO of Europe's biggest carmaker,
Volkswagen <VOWG.DE>, said he welcomed the Commission's
""pragmatic approach"" that did not impact CO2 reduction and gave
carmakers flexibility to accelerate demand with affordable new
models.
  
    Renault said the Commission's flexible approach would allow
EU automakers to reduce emissions and stay competitive as the EV
market ramped up.
        Sigrid de Vries, director general of European auto
manufacturers' association ACEA, said the proposal was positive,
but meeting the targets would still be very challenging.    
Matthias Zink, president of European auto suppliers' association
CLEPA, said the proposal offered ""limited relief"".
        ACEA, which had sought a longer extension, has said the
industry faced unpalatable alternatives, including deep price
cuts, reduced production or buying credits from U.S. electric
car maker Tesla <TSLA.O> and Chinese electric vehicle makers.
    Volvo Cars, which is majority owned by Chinese EV maker
Geely [GEELY.UL], said companies that had done their homework to
be ready for 2025 should not be disadvantaged by last-minute
changes.
    Transport research and campaign group T&E described the
proposal as an unprecedented gift to the car industry that would
leave Europe further behind China.
        ""The key to competitiveness is to be able to produce
electric vehicles at a price mass consumers want them. That's
what the Chinese have done,"" said T&E executive director William
Todts. ""Postponing this in Europe does not make you more
competitive.""
    The EU executive intends to publish its automotive action
plan on Wednesday to ensure EU car producers can electrify their
fleets and compete with more advanced rivals.

 (Updates to mid-session trading)
    By Johann M Cherian and Sukriti Gupta
       March 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main stock indexes
slipped on Monday after data showed that new orders at U.S.
factories fell in February, while investors awaited details on
tariffs on top trading partners that are expected to kick in at
the end of the day.
    An ISM survey showed manufacturing was steady in February,
but a measure tracking forward-looking new orders contracted to
48.6 last month from 55.1 in January. 
    Although, business activity is in expansion territory by a
narrow margin, given the tariff uncertainty in the near term, it
is likely that data will continue to reflect a cooling economy
until there is more clarity on U.S. President Donald Trump's
trade policies, said Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill
Capital LLC. 
    Trump is expected to decide what levels of tariffs he will
impose early on Tuesday on Canada and Mexico amid last-minute
negotiations over border security and efforts to halt the inflow
of fentanyl opioids.
    
    
    At 11:58 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI>
fell 98.69 points, or 0.23%, to 43,742.22, the S&P 500 <.SPX>
lost 10.48 points, or 0.18%, to 5,944.02 and the Nasdaq
Composite <.IXIC> lost 64.37 points, or 0.36%, to 18,780.35. 
    Technology <.SPLRCT> led declines among the S&P 500's 11
sectors with a 0.9% drop, dragged down by a 4.5% fall in chip
giant Nvidia <NVDA.O>.
    Defensive sectors such as healthcare <.SPXHC> and consumer
staples <.SPLRCS> gained about 0.6% each, while cyclical stocks
such as materials <.SPLRCM> and energy <.SPNY> dipped after the
data.
    Recent reports of softening consumer demand have spurred
fears of a slowdown as markets prepare for higher inflation once
Donald Trump administration's tariff policies take full effect.
    Wall Street's main indexes logged their first monthly
decline of 2025 in February, during which the Nasdaq also came
close to a 10% drop from its all-time high due to fears of a
rise in inflation induced by tariffs and other factors.    
    
    Trump has also threatened that an extra 10% duty on imports
from China will also take effect on Tuesday, which could spark a
retaliation from Beijing.
    U.S-listed shares of Chinese companies fell, with Nio
<NIO.N> and JD.com <JD.O> off about 4.5% and 2.4%, respectively.
    The Federal Reserve has been cautious on interest rate cuts
in anticipation of sticky inflation, but this week's employment
and business activity data, could change the institution's
outlook.
    Traders have dialed up bets on the Fed's 2025 monetary
policy easing cycle to at least two 25 basis points worth of
interest rate cuts by December, according to data compiled by
LSEG.
    Tesla <TSLA.O> rose 3.1% after Morgan Stanley reinstated the
stock as 'top pick' among U.S. autos. 
    Crypto stocks such as MicroStrategy <MSTR.O> jumped 3.7%,
Coinbase <COIN.O> rose 1.9% after Trump announced a proposed
reserve of digital assets.
    Chipmaker Intel <INTC.O> rose 3.6% after a report that chip
designers Nvidia <NVDA.O> and Broadcom <AVGO.O> were running
manufacturing tests with the company. 
    Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.33-to-1 ratio
on the NYSE, while declining issues outnumbered advancers by a
1.23-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
    The S&P 500 posted 55 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows,
while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 49 new highs and 205 new
lows.

2025-03-03 16:13:43,"Tesla rises 2% as Morgan Stanley backs AI, robotics efforts with 'top pick' status",urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250303:nL3N3PM0YL:5,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"By Kanchana Chakravarty and Aditya Soni
       March 3 (Reuters) - Tesla shares rose 2% on Monday after
Morgan Stanley reinstated the electric-vehicle maker as its top
U.S. auto pick, saying the company's artificial intelligence and
robotics efforts could power growth even as the mainstay car
business stumbles.
    The note dated Sunday was the latest from analyst Adam
Jonas, a longtime Tesla <TSLA.O> bull who has praised the
company's push beyond autos as sales face pressure from high
U.S. borrowing costs and fierce Chinese competition including
from BYD <002594.SZ>.
    Industry data showed Tesla sales fell 45% in Europe in
January while overall EV sales jumped 37% in the region. 
    Jonas said recent setbacks, including Tesla's first annual
deliveries drop in 2024, signaled its shift from an ""automotive
pure play to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics.""
    He reaffirmed his $430 price target, one of Wall Street's
highest, which implies a 44% upside to the stock's last trade. 
    The remarks echoed Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has pivoted the
automaker to robotaxis and AI in the past year, even as experts
argue that large-scale adoption of the vehicles could be years
away due to regulatory hurdles and technological limitations.
    Jonas is no stranger to bold Tesla predictions. In September
2023, he said Tesla's Dojo supercomputer could boost its market
value by nearly $600 billion through advancements in robotaxis. 
 
    Since then, Tesla's market value has risen by about $150
billion to nearly $950 billion. 
        But its shares have trailed the broader U.S. market this
year, declining 27% as early euphoria over Donald Trump's
election win waned, giving way to concerns about weakening sales
and CEO Elon Musk's White House engagements.
  
    While Musk has promised sales growth this year with the
launch of cheaper models, Jonas said deliveries could decline in
2025, providing an ""attractive entry point.""
    In October, Tesla showcased its robotaxi, while Musk touted
progress on its humanoid robot ""Optimus,"" which could eventually
be priced at $20,000 to $30,000.
    Musk has said Tesla will roll out driverless ride-hailing
services in California and Texas this year but provided no
further details.

 (Adds figures from France in paragraphs 4-5)
    By Terje Solsvik and Louise  Rasmussen
       OSLO/COPENHAGEN, March 3 (Reuters) - Tesla <TSLA.O>
sales plunged in Scandinavia and France in February from a year
ago, eroding its market share, as the electric vehicle maker
faced a brand loyalty test amid CEO Elon Musk's role in U.S.
President Donald Trump's administration.
    Tesla, whose cars topped sales charts in Norway, Sweden and
Denmark in 2023 and 2024, has slipped this year behind rivals
with newer model lineups, such as Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> and
Toyota <7203.T>, registration data showed on Monday.
    
    
    A total of 613 new Teslas were registered in Sweden last
month, down 42% year-on-year, while registrations in Norway and
Denmark each fell by 48% to 917 and 509 cars respectively,
despite rising overall auto demand in the three countries,
including for EVs.
    Tesla registrations in France also declined by 45% over the
first two months of the year compared to the same period in
2024, data published on Saturday by French car body PFA showed,
continuing this year's negative trend in Europe.
        Last year, the company's Model Y was the most sold EV in
France and the 10th most sold car, while this year, it's only
27th so far and outpaced by the electric Peugeot 208, Renault 5
and Citroen e-C3.
  
    Musk's entry into politics, his sweeping cuts to the U.S.
federal workforce and endorsing of far-right political views in
Europe has triggered ""Tesla Takedown"" demonstrations in the
United States and calls for boycotts elsewhere.
    The company did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.
    In Norway, where almost all new cars are fully electric,
Tesla's share of overall car sales has slipped to 8.8%
year-to-date from a market-leading 18.9% for the full-year 2024
and 20% in 2023.
    
    LOYALTY TEST
    Held back also by an ageing vehicle lineup, the company
faces a test in the coming months as it prepares to introduce an
upgraded version in Europe of its Model Y mid-size SUV, the
Scandinavian region's best-selling car in the last two years.
    But it was unclear if Tesla would recapture its former
position as the people's car of choice, the Norwegian Road
Federation (OFV), an industry group, said on Monday.
    ""The brand has had a unique market position in Norway for
several years. Whether that will continue is uncertain, because
there is a lot of unrest and noise around Tesla and Elon Musk,""
the OFV said in a statement.
    In Denmark, a growing number of prospective buyers seeking
advice from the Danish Federation of Motorists (FDM) said they
were looking for alternatives to the Texas-based auto maker.
    ""A lot of people start by saying, 'I want to buy an electric
car, but I don't want it to be a Tesla'… The political consumer
has always been there, but it's more pronounced with Tesla now,""
FDM chief adviser Ilyas Dogru said.
    Long-admired as a successful industrialist, Musk himself
appeared to have become the car brand's biggest enemy, said Atle
Falch Tuverud, editor-in-chief of Norwegian auto trade
publication BilNytt.
    ""There is little doubt that Tesla has now lost some of its
existing customers, and it is absolutely certain that they have
lost some of their potential customers,"" Tuverud said, adding it
could take several months to fully assess the impact on sales.
    An initial answer may come in the months from March to June
this year, when shipments begin of the redesigned Model Y, and
the company could also opt to compete more aggressively on
price, FDM's Dogru said.

being below 25% level.)
       March 3 (Reuters) - The United States' proposed tariffs
on Canada and Mexico will take effect on Tuesday, but President
Donald Trump will determine whether they would be set at the
proposed 25%, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said. 
    Here are the automakers and other companies that could be
affected by the tariffs:

    AUDI
    Volkswagen's <VOWG_p.DE> Audi plant in San Jose Chiapa,
Mexico, makes the Q5, employing over 5,000 people. In the first
half of 2024, nearly 40,000 vehicles were exported to the U.S.,
according to Mexico's AMIA.

    BMW
    BMW's <BMWG.DE> plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, produces
the 3 Series, 2 Series Coupe and M2, with nearly all output
going to the U.S. and other markets worldwide. 

    FORD
    Ford <F.N> has three plants in Mexico. It exported just
under 196,000 cars to North America in the first half of 2024,
with 90% going to the U.S., according to Mexico's AMIA.
 
    GENERAL MOTORS
    GM <GM.N> imported roughly 750,000 vehicles from Canada or
Mexico in 2024 to the U.S., with most made in Mexico, GlobalData
says. They include the Chevy Silverado, GMC Sierra full-sized
pickups, and mid-sized SUVs. The Mexican plants also build two
of its new EVs. 
    GM's three plants in Canada produce electric vans, the
Chevrolet Silverado Heavy Duty truck, and the V8 engine and dual
clutch transmission.


    HONDA MOTOR
    Honda Motor <7267.T> sends 80% of its Mexican output to the
U.S. market. It warned on Nov. 6 that it would have to consider
shifting production if the U.S. imposed permanent tariffs on
Mexican imports.

    JAC MOTORS
    JAC Motors <600418.SS> assembles JAC brand vehicles via a
joint venture with Mexican firm Giant Motors. 
    
    KIA CORP
    South Korea's Kia Corp <000270.KS> has a factory in Mexico
that makes its own vehicles and some Santa Fe SUVs for its
affiliate Hyundai Motor <005380.KS> for export to the United
States.

    MAZDA
    Mazda <7261.T> exported around 120,000 vehicles from Mexico
to the United States in 2023, but said it may reconsider further
investments if tariffs are imposed.

    NISSAN MOTOR
    Nissan Motor <7201.T> has two plants in Mexico where it
makes the Sentra, Versa and Kicks models for the U.S. market. It
produced nearly 505,000 vehicles in Mexico in the first nine
months of 2024.

    STELLANTIS
    Stellantis <STLAM.MI> operates assembly plants in Mexico
making Ram pick-ups and vans, as well as the Jeep Compass
mid-sized SUV. The group owns two assembly plants in Canada: one
where it makes Chrysler models, and another scheduled to resume
output of a new Jeep model this year.

    TOYOTA MOTOR
    Toyota Motor <7203.T> builds its Tacoma pick-up truck at two
plants in Mexico, and sold more than 230,000 of them in the U.S.
in 2023, or 10% of total sales in that market. 
    
    VOLKSWAGEN
    Volkswagen's factory in Puebla, Mexico, made nearly 350,000
cars in 2023, including the Jetta, Tiguan and Taos, all for
export to the U.S. In Canada, Volkswagen is building a battery
gigafactory in Ontario, with output to begin by 2027.

    AUTO SUPPLIERS

    AUTOLIV
    Sweden's Autoliv <ALIVsdb.ST>, the world's largest maker of
airbags and seat belts, employs around 15,000 staff in Mexico.

    MICHELIN
    Tyre maker Michelin <MICP.PA> has two plants in Mexico -
Queretaro and Leon - and three in Canada.

    YANFENG
    Chinese seat maker Yanfeng Automotive Interiors supplies
automakers including General Motors and Toyota from its plants
in Mexico.

    OTHERS
    Other part makers with plants in Mexico include Italian
tyremaker Pirelli <PIRC.MI>, Italian premium brakes maker Brembo
<BRBI.MI> and Italy's Eurogroup Laminations <EGLA.MI>.
    U.S. automaker Tesla encouraged its Chinese suppliers to set
up plants in Mexico in 2023 to supply the factory it was
planning to build in the country from early 2025, but its plans
have not materialised.

       NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - Nine people were arrested
during a raucous demonstration outside a New York City Tesla
<TSLA.O> dealership on Saturday, protesting owner Elon Musk's
role in sweeping cuts to the federal workforce at the behest of
President Donald Trump.
    The protest, which police said involved hundreds of people,
was one of a wave of ""Tesla Takedown"" demonstrations staged
across the country targeting billionaire Musk, who is
spearheading the Trump administration's so-called Department of
Government Efficiency, or DOGE.
    Throngs of protesters also descended on the electric vehicle
maker's showrooms in Jacksonville, Florida, Tucson, Arizona, and
other cities, blocking traffic, chanting and waving signs
reading ""Burn a Tesla: Save Democracy,"" and ""No Dictators in the
USA."" 
    Musk, the world's richest person, is leading an
unprecedented push to shrink the federal government that has
resulted in the firing of thousands of employees and the
termination of hundreds of aid contracts and federal leases.
    Tesla and a White House spokesperson did not immediately
respond to attempts to seek comment by phone and email on
Saturday night.
    In some cases, federal agencies have been forced to try to
hire back key workers that had been fired, including some
responsible for America's nuclear weapons, scientists trying to
fight a worsening outbreak of bird flu and officials responsible
for supplying electricity.
    At least 100,000 of the 2.3 million federal employees have
agreed to buy-outs or have been fired since Trump took office on
January 20.
    ""We are taking action at Tesla, Musk's flagship company,""
the organizers said on the website actionnetwork.org, calling
for people to dump Tesla stock and ""join the picket lines.""
    ""Detaching Musk from Tesla would be a meaningful blow
against this administration and its prerogatives, because it
would be a strike against what they hold most dear: money and
power,"" actor and filmmaker Alex Winter wrote in a Rolling Stone
article. Winter has posted on social media that he helped
organize the protests.

    By Noel Randewich
       Feb 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended higher on Friday
after a choppy trading session, with Dell Technologies dipping
and other tech stocks climbing after a meeting between the U.S.
President Donald Trump and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr
Zelenskiy ended in disaster.
    Zelenskiy and Trump traded verbal blows at the White House
before the world's media. This created fresh uncertainty over
Ukraine's war with Russia for investors already worried about
sticky U.S. inflation and a tepid economy. 
    The S&P 500 moved lower immediately after the clash before
recovering and ending the day with a gain.
    Zelenskiy left the White House without signing a
much-vaunted deal between Ukraine and the U.S. over the joint
development of natural resources.
    ""The news, if you watched it live, it was pretty worrisome.
It got heated, and Zelenskiy is considered an ally of the U.S.,""
said Adam Sarhan, chief executive at 50 Park Investments.
""That's why the market sold off, but then cooler heads
prevailed. Zelenskiy either is going to make a deal or he's
not.""    
    Dell <DELL.N> dropped 4.7% after the PC maker forecast a
decline in its adjusted gross margin rate for fiscal 2026.
    Peer HP Inc <HPQ.N> fell 6.8% after its quarterly profit
forecasts missed expectations.
    Nvidia <NVDA.O> and Tesla <TSLA.O> rose almost 4% each and
lifted the S&P 500.
        The S&P 500 climbed 1.59% to end the session at 5,954.50
points.
  
        The Nasdaq gained 1.63% to 18,847.28 points, while the
Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.39% to 43,840.91 points.
  
        Volume on U.S. exchanges was heavy, with 17.5 billion
shares traded, compared to an average of 15.4 billion shares
over the previous 20 sessions.
  
        All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, led by financials
<.SPSY>, up 2.1%, followed by a 1.8% gain in consumer
discretionary <.SPLRCD>.
  
        For the week, the S&P 500 fell about 1%, the Nasdaq lost
3.5% and the Dow climbed almost 1%. 
  
        The Nasdaq lost about 4% for all of February, its
deepest monthly loss since April 2024. The S&P 500 fell 1.45%
for the month and the Dow lost 1.6%.
  
    Earlier, a Commerce Department report showed inflation rose
in January in line with expectations. However, consumer
spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the
economy, dropped 0.2% after an upwardly revised 0.8% increase in
December. This could complicate the Federal Reserve's
deliberations on monetary policy.
    ""Spending came in lower than we were looking for... most of
it I would attribute to a cooling economy, which presents a
dilemma for the Fed in the sense that you still have inflation
and you have an economy that is moving lower. If you add them
together, that equals stagflation,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief
market economist at Spartan Capital Securities.
    Friday's report is important for investors trying to gauge
the next move for the central bank after policymakers reiterated
a hawkish stance. Investors worry Trump's policies, especially
trade restrictions, could exacerbate U.S. inflation.
    ""Tariff talk certainly is having a negative effect on the
stock market, and it probably will keep a lid on stock market
advances until there's more clarity around that,"" said Sam
Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.
    Traders see the Fed lowering borrowing costs twice by
December, little changed from before the report, according to
data compiled by LSEG. Investors will assess comments from
Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee later in the day. 
    The CBOE Volatility Index <.VIX>, also known as Wall
Street's fear gauge, touched a one-month high and was last up at
21.26 points.
        Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P
500 <.AD.SPX> by a 7.1-to-one ratio.
  
        The S&P 500 posted 39 new highs and 14 new lows; the
Nasdaq recorded 43 new highs and 332 new lows.

      Trump's plan to kill EV subsidies would test GM's EV
momentum
    

  
    By Kalea Hall
       DETROIT, Feb 28 (Reuters) - General Motors has spent
billions over decades trying to blaze an electric trail,
releasing pioneering EVs and hybrids that ultimately failed to
achieve mass-market sales before being scrapped. This time might
be different.
    Last year, the U.S. auto-sales leader boosted electric
vehicle sales and seized market share from the likes of Tesla
despite slowing demand as its customers increasingly chose EVs
over comparable GM <GM.N> gas-powered models.
    The progress - driven by an expanding EV lineup that will
soon include a dozen models - signals that GM could for the
first time convince more mainstream buyers to go electric, four
industry analysts said.
    GM's fourth-quarter share of U.S. EVs hit 12% - double a
year earlier and second only to Tesla <TSLA.O> at 44.4%,
according to auto services specialist Cox Automotive.
    Sales of GM's Cadillac Lyriq EV tripled last year to 28,402,
outpacing each of its XT4, XT5 and XT6 gasoline SUVs. Sales of
its lower-priced Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer EVs accounted for
22% and 40% respectively of total fourth-quarter deliveries
under the same model name.
    The growth underscores GM's stubborn commitment to EVs,
despite heavy losses and a trend among rivals including Ford
<F.N> and Toyota <7203.T> to prioritize gas-electric hybrids.
    Analysts credited GM's EV surge to its growing number of
competitive models - from entry-level to premium - giving its
customers more electric options than rivals. Tesla, for example,
has five models and only two volume sellers.
    GM global markets chief Rory Harvey cited the same reason in
an interview with Reuters.
    ""We've got the broadest lineup out there, and we definitely
have momentum,"" he said. ""And we all know that the automotive
industry is a momentum game.""
    
    ACID TEST
    Aggressive pricing also played a role in the form of
low-payment leases that often made GM EVs cheaper than its
comparable fuel-powered vehicles, according to industry analysts
and two GM dealers.
    Such cheap EV leases, common industry-wide, were made
possible largely by a $7,500 subsidy that U.S. President Donald
Trump is expected to end along with a host of other pro-EV
policies. GM would also be vulnerable to Trump's threatened 25%
tariffs on Canada and Mexico because it makes hundreds of
thousands of cars in Mexico - including the Blazer and Equinox
EVs.
    Industry experts said political and EV market headwinds will
make 2025 an acid test for whether GM can sustain its momentum
and hit a tipping point in its long and expensive history of
electrification efforts. One pivotal moment will come later this
year as GM launches the next-generation Bolt, expected to be its
most affordable EV at about $30,000.
    ""This year is critical for them,"" said Paul Waatti, industry
analysis director at research firm AutoPacific.
    GM has historically been first out the gate with innovative
electrified cars only to stumble in launches dating back to its
1997 EV1, a futuristic pill-shaped two-door. GM also introduced
the first mass-produced plug-in hybrid, the 2011 Volt, and
followed up with the all-electric 2017 Bolt, the only relatively
affordable EV at the time. All were discontinued without
achieving volume sales.
    Despite its recent progress, GM still faces immense
challenges in delivering on CEO Mary Barra's past pledge of an
all-electric fleet by 2035. EVs only comprised about 6% of GM's
overall fourth-quarter sales, which continue to rely on large
trucks and SUVs that are among the hardest vehicles to
electrify, industry experts say.
    
    PROGRESS TOWARD PROFIT
    Instead of just one Volt or Bolt, GM now offers 10 models,
from the affordable Equinox crossover to six-figure SUVs.
Cadillac just launched its Optiq compact electric SUV, which
will be followed soon by a three-row Vistiq and lower-priced
electric pickups.
    GM says it's also getting closer to making EV profits. CFO
Paul Jacobson has said GM plans to narrow EV losses by about $2
billion in 2025, without disclosing total annual losses. That
estimate, however, depends on continued EV sales growth, which
could prove hard if Trump guts EV purchase and lease subsidies.
    Losing the $7,500 incentive could tank EV sales unless
automakers cut prices, said Ivan Drury, director of insights for
automotive research firm Edmunds.
    ""We know what happens if you don't provide it,"" he said of
EV subsidies and discounts. ""You don't sell.""
    GM said it had not decided whether to lower prices if the
subsidies end and that it would wait to assess consumer and
competitor reactions. GM nonetheless takes a ""very long-term
view"" of its EV commitment, said spokesman Jim Cain.
    A $7,500 EV lease incentive has been key to low-payment
deals to persuade skeptical EV shoppers. More than 70% of EVs
were leased last year at dealerships, including 55% of GM's
electric vehicles, Edmunds data shows.
    ""It's really the lease offer that makes the big difference,""
said Jeff Laethem, at Detroit's Ray Laethem Motor Village, which
includes a Buick and GMC store. For some premium models, it's a
$700 monthly payment for a $100,000 vehicle, he said.
    
    EVS OVER HYBRIDS
    GM continues to bet big on EVs at a time when rivals such as
Ford and Toyota have focused more on hybrids - a decision that
has paid off for them as consumers turn to hybrids in droves to
avoid the cost and charging hassles of EVs.
    Toyota has long dominated the hybrid market and sells few
EVs, arguing that EV technology isn't yet advanced or affordable
enough for most customers. Hybrids represented more than 40% of
Toyota's 2.3 million U.S. deliveries last year. Ford's hybrid
sales jumped 40% to about 187,000, nearly double its EV sales of
some 98,000.
    GM, by comparison, sold 114,432 EVs. The automaker plans to
offer plug-in hybrids for 2027 as a short-term strategy to meet
emissions regulations but has no plans to make traditional
hybrids, which cost less and don't need charging.
    ""Ultimately, we believe that EVs are going to be the way
forward,"" GM's Harvey said, ""complemented with some hybrids.""
    At a New York industry conference in February, CEO Barra
called hybrids an interim solution, arguing that developing a
vehicle with two propulsion systems - gas and electric - is an
inefficient use of capital.
    GM might be better off sticking to EVs in part because it
would now take substantial investment in hybrid powertrains to
steal sales from entrenched competitors, said David Whiston, an
automotive stock strategist at Morningstar Research. 
    ""It would be hard for GM to compete head-on with Toyota in
hybrids,"" he said.
    GM officials argue it's not missing out on sales in the
hybrid boom because it offers other fuel-saving technologies,
such as diesels and small, turbocharged gasoline engines.
    
    THE TRUCK DILEMMA
    The biggest obstacle to GM's all-electric ambitions,
however, might be its own lucrative business in full-sized
pickups and SUVs.
    GM's ambitions for a rapid electric truck transition have so
far clashed with the challenges of making them affordable and
capable enough to sell in large volumes. In 2022, GM planned
annual capacity for 600,000 electric trucks at its Detroit
Factory Zero plant and another factory it planned to reopen in
nearby Orion Township. It has repeatedly delayed the Orion
reopening, now scheduled for mid-2026.
    GM started delivering the Silverado EV RST First Edition,
priced at $94,500, in mid-2024. But it sold just 9,000 electric
Silverado and Sierra pickups last year out of about 900,000
total. Rivals' electric trucks introduced before last year -
Ford's F-150 Lightning and Tesla's Cybertruck - had about 33,000
and 39,000 sales in 2024, respectively, but the overall electric
truck segment remains tiny.
    This year, GM hopes to boost sales with two new trim levels
starting at about $57,000 and $73,000.
    One drag on EV pickup sales is the fact that carrying or
towing heavy payloads can dramatically reduce their driving
range, requiring constant recharging. 
    Seeking more range, automakers have added larger batteries,
but that makes EV trucks extremely expensive, said Sam
Abuelsamid, vice president of market research for Telemetry
Insights.
    GM's highly profitable truck-and-SUV business has been
pivotal in helping GM finance money-losing forays into EVs and
autonomous vehicles. But it will struggle to squeeze the same
profits from electric trucks, Abuelsamid said.
    ""For the foreseeable future,"" he said, ""they're probably not
going to be able to get the same margins - not unless we have
some major breakthrough on the battery front.""

       BEIJING, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Autonomous driving-related
over-the-air software upgrades will be subject to regulatory
approvals, China's industry ministry said on Friday, part of new
regulations aimed at preventing automakers using them to conceal
defects or avoid liability.
    Electric vehicle makers including Tesla <TSLA.O> and Xiaomi
<1810.HK> have used OTA upgrades to fix software bugs. Such
upgrades are called product recalls under China's regulation,
but it's often unclear if drivers might need, or would be
eligible, to return vehicles to the automakers for refunds.
    Those planning OTA upgrades to eliminate product defects and
implement recalls should ""immediately stop the manufacture and
sales of defective automobile products,"" the regulation
stipulates.
    If changes to the main technical parameters are needed to
fix the defects, automakers are required to obtain a license for
the product change before resuming their production of the
affected vehicle.
    Automakers are banned from naming and marketing driving
assistance systems with hints to consumers that they can be used
as autonomous driving systems, according to the regulation.
    They are also required to report to the industry ministry
and the market regulator in case of driving assistance system
failure or collisions and other accidents.

2025-02-27 23:51:11,UPDATE 4-Tesla seeking first in series of approvals to offer robotaxi service in California,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250227:nL3N3PI1Z1:1,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"(Adds sourcing from California regulators)
       Feb 27 (Reuters) - Tesla <TSLA.O> has applied for a permit typically associated with
chauffeur-operated services, according to California regulators, marking the first phase of a
series of regulatory approvals required for the electric car maker to eventually launch a
promised robotaxi service.
    The automaker currently has the approval to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver in
California, but does not have a permit for driverless testing or operations from the state's
Department of Motor Vehicles, which would be needed to apply for a driverless taxi service in
the state.
    Musk has in the past year pivoted Tesla to robotaxis as demand slows for its aging lineup of
electric vehicles — a high-stakes bet that has lifted the company's stock but could face
regulatory roadblocks. Investors are counting on the billionaire's close ties to U.S. President
Donald Trump to simplify that process.
    In November, Tesla applied for a transportation charter-party carrier permit from the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), according to an agency spokesperson. That
classification means Tesla would own and control a fleet of vehicles, but is separate from the
CPUC's autonomous vehicle permits. 
    Tesla did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The CPUC told Reuters that getting
the transportation charter-party carrier permit is a pre-requisite to receiving authorization to
operate an autonomous ride-hailing service, but the current application would not allow Tesla to
offer any autonomous vehicle rides to the public ""in any capacity.""
    Tesla would still need to apply for and receive a permit to operate an autonomous passenger
service, according to the CPUC.
    Based on California's regulations, Tesla would only be able to apply for an autonomous
ride-hailing service with a safety driver in the vehicle. It would not be able to charge
passengers for service.
    Tesla would need additional permits from the California DMV and CPUC in order to operate the
service without safety drivers in the vehicles, or to charge customers. 
    Tesla was offering an app-based ride-hailing service, with a safety driver, to employees in
the San Francisco Bay Area, Musk said during an earnings call in October.
    He added that Tesla would roll out driverless ride-hailing services to the public in
California and Texas this year, without offering more specific details.
    Earlier in October, Tesla revealed the Cybercab, a robotaxi concept that had no steering
wheel or control pedals.
    Musk in January said Tesla would begin offering ""autonomous ride-hailing for money"" in
Austin this June, and said Tesla would release an ""unsupervised"" version of its Full
Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assistance system in California this year, without offering more
information. 
    He has said the Cybercab will go into production in 2026 and will also be available for
customers to buy for less than $30,000.
    However, with autonomous technology proving harder and more expensive to solve, industry
experts have warned it could take Tesla several years to commercialize a robotaxi.
    Bloomberg News first reported the Tesla application to California regulators.

rebranded as Trading Day as of March 3. It's not just the title

markets from Jamie McGeever, Reuters' markets columnist. We hope
you'll enjoy the new format.)
    By Jamie McGeever
       Feb 28 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian
markets. 
     
A mega wave of regional economic data breaks on Asian markets on
Friday, with investors already bracing for a nervous end to the
month as they weigh up tariff threats from Washington, further
signs of U.S. economic slowdown, and fatigue on Wall Street.
Top-tier indicators from Asia due on Friday include Tokyo
inflation, Japanese retail sales and industrial production, and
fourth quarter GDP from India, while keenly-awaited PCE
inflation figures from the US will also be released. 
    The mood going into the final trading day of the month is
pessimistic, soured by deepening concerns over the impact U.S.
President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs will have on growth.  
In the last 24 hours Trump has said 25% duties will be slapped
on imports from the European Union, reiterated that tariffs on
imports from Canada and Mexico will come into effect on March 4
- not April 2 as he had previously suggested - and said goods
from China will be subject to an additional 10% duty.
Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda echoed these concerns from
Cape Town, where the G20 meeting of finance ministers and
central bank governors - which officials from many countries,
including the U.S., skipped - concluded without consensus or
communique.
This is another sign of the fraying of the global financial and
economic order that has held for decades. The G20 ""chair's
summary"" said participants ""reiterated the commitment to
resisting protectionism,"" but the wind from Washington is
blowing in the opposite direction.
The impact on stocks continues to be most visible in tech. The
Nasdaq fell sharply again on Thursday and is now down 5% year to
date, significantly underperforming the Dow and S&P 500.
     
     
    Chipmaker Nvidia may have issued reasonably decent results
and forecasts on Wednesday but investors slammed the shares down
8.5% on Thursday. The upside for continued growth in revenue,
earnings and the share price at the pace seen in recent years is
negligible, so it's understandable fatigue is setting in.
    Tesla shares are also on the slide, extending their losses
on Thursday to more than 20% in barely a week. An ETF tracking
the 'Magnificent Seven' U.S. tech shares hit a three-month low
on Thursday too, and is down almost 10% since Feb. 18.
U.S. Big Tech's losses have been Chinese tech's gains, a
rotation turbo-charged by the emergence of Chinese low-cost
artificial intelligence model DeepSeek. Hong Kong-listed Chinese
tech shares hit a fresh three-year high on Thursday before
closing lower, and are on track for a monthly gain of 25%.
But with U.S. yields and the dollar also up, Asian stocks and
currencies are set to open on Friday under pressure. 
    Here are key developments that could provide more direction
to Asian markets on Friday:
    - Japan Tokyo inflation (February)
    - Japan industrial production, retail sales (January)
    - India GDP (Q4)

 (Changes headline, recasts paragraphs 1-4, updates share price)
    By Arsheeya Bajwa
       Feb 27 (Reuters) - 
    Wall Street took a dim view of Nvidia's <NVDA.O> quarterly
forecast on Thursday with investors pushing the stock down more
than 8%, piling pressure on the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks that
have garnered market skepticism in the last three months. 
    The stock closed lower at $120.15, while other members of
the group such as Microsoft <MSFT.O> and Amazon <AMZN.O> also
ended the session weaker, after Nvidia's earnings failed to
inspire the kind of gains that became a hallmark of the AI rally
through 2023 and 2024. 
        To be sure, Nvidia's first-quarter revenue forecast was
better than market estimates, with CEO Jensen Huang also noting
the company was seeing ""amazing"" demand for its new Blackwell
chips. 
        But growth is slowing. Nvidia's projected revenue
increase of about 65% is far from the triple-digit growth that
investors have been accustomed to in the past year, while the
company also expects gross margin to dip to 71%, the lowest
level in at least a year. 
  
    Nvidia is viewed as a barometer of the health of AI spending
and the two-year boom propelled its valuation to more than $3
trillion. Investors were hoping its results would restart a
rally that has sputtered following the ""Magnificent Seven""
stocks' peaks in late 2024. 
    In recent weeks, Chinese startup DeepSeek's low-cost AI
model had fanned investor skepticism over the billions of
dollars earmarked by Big Tech for AI infrastructure, with many
of the stocks still struggling to recoup the losses.
    Fears of a pullback in spending on Nvidia's priciest AI
chips vaporized more than half a trillion dollars of its
stock-market value in a single day last month, a record on Wall
Street.
    And more recently, an analyst report that Microsoft had cut
back on data-center leases reignited concerns over tech
companies' spending.  
    Nvidia's report was eyed as a bellwether for chip spending
on generative AI - and while it indicated demand remains strong,
it did not quell concerns among investors who were hoping for
more. 
        ""(The) results and guidance were relatively in line with
market expectations − not bullish enough to see another beat and
raise,"" said HSBC Global Research analyst Frank Lee.  
  
    Nvidia expects total revenue of $43 billion, plus or minus
2% for the first quarter, compared with analysts' average
estimate of $41.78 billion, according to LSEG.
    The massive revenue surges and beats that had become
synonymous with Nvidia, however, are becoming a thing of the
past. 
    The company's January-quarter revenue of $39.33 billion beat
estimates by a margin of 3.4%, compared with a beat of more than
7% in the year-ago period.   
     
    
        Nvidia's Huang on Wednesday said the company had already
pulled in around $11 billion in revenue related to its Blackwell
processor in the fourth quarter. 
  
        The world's second-most valuable company has been the
top beneficiary of an AI-driven spending spree over the past two
years, with its shares gaining more than 400% in that period.
  
           
  
       
  
    Of the 63 analysts covering the stock, 33 have a ""strong
buy"" rating, as per LSEG data. The median price target stood at
$175, implying that analysts expect a 33% increase from the
stock's Wednesday close.
    Nvidia shares recently traded at about 29 times their
forward earnings, down from more than 80 two years ago, as
rising earnings pull down the premium at which the stock trades.
Rival Advanced Micro Devices <AMD.O> trades at about 22 times
its forward earnings.   
    ""At around 30x forward earnings the valuation still doesn't
look overcooked,"" said Derren Nathan, head of equity research at
Hargreaves Lansdown.

       Feb 27 (Reuters) - (Billable Hours is Reuters' weekly
report on lawyers and money. Please send tips or suggestions to
D.Thomas@thomsonreuters.com)
    
    Some top partners at U.S. law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &
Sullivan are now charging a standard fee of $3,000 an hour,
Reuters reported this week, signaling a new high for the
industry.
    Lawyers at at least one other firm have hit the same
milestone: Litigator Neal Manne said on Thursday that he and his
partner Bill Carmody at Susman Godfrey also adopted $3,000
hourly rates this year, though he said they often agree on
case-specific fees instead of charging by the hour. 
        Manne's clients include Chevron and Live Nation, and
Carmody has represented ride-sharing giant Uber. 
  
    With law firm billing rates swiftly rising at big firms
around the country and nearly doubling in the past decade,
lawyers at other large firms are not far behind. 
    A review of court filings in bankruptcies and other cases
shows that several firms are now charging top hourly rates above
$2,500.
    Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati said last year that some of
its partners would begin billing client Rite Aid up to $2,720 an
hour for bankruptcy work. 
    Some partners at Kirkland & Ellis, ranked the
highest-grossing U.S. law firm by The American Lawyer, said in
December they would bill at $2,675 an hour this year, up from
$2,445 in 2024.
    Second-ranked Latham & Watkins said in December that its
partners were charging up to $2,745 an hour in the Chapter 11
bankruptcy of online used car seller Vroom.
    Sidley Austin said in a January 29 application to represent
Prospect Medical Group in the hospital group's bankruptcy that
its partners would charge $2,610 an hour this year. 
    Law firms do not typically publicize their rates, but they
are sometimes required to disclose them in bankruptcies and
class actions or may reveal them in public contracts with
governmental clients. 
    Reuters reached out to more than 35 of the largest U.S.
firms to ask about their rates, and whether any of their lawyers
charge $3,000 or more. The firms either declined to comment or
did not immediately respond to a request for one.
    At Quinn Emanuel, the $3,000 dollar rate applies to a
handful of partners such as Alex Spiro, whose clients have
included billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk and rapper Jay-Z. Even
associates at the firm now bill as much as $1,665 an hour,
according to court filings.
    U.S. law firms often raise their billing rates each year,
and average hourly partner rates reached $1,114 last year,
according to a survey of large firms by legal recruiter and
consultancy Major, Lindsey & Africa. That's up 36% from the
company's last survey in 2022, and up 83% from 2014.
    A survey of more than 130 U.S. law firms by Wells Fargo's
legal business division found that billing rates rose by 9.1% on
average in 2024, with the 50 highest-grossing U.S. law firms
raising them by 10% on average.
    As billing rates rise, so do law firm revenue, profits and
lawyer pay. The same survey by Wells Fargo's Legal Specialty
Group found that law firm revenue rose by 12.5% on average last
year. Equity partner profits increased by 16.9% on average,
Wells Fargo found.
    Major Lindsey in its 2024 report said rate increases were a
key factor in ""the highest-ever average total compensation
figure and the highest percentage increase in the survey's
history.""
    
-- Tesla <TSLA.O> said in a court filing on Tuesday that it has
paid $176.1 million in attorney fees awarded to plaintiffs'
lawyers who negotiated a $919 million settlement with the
electric carmaker over allegations that Tesla's board members
overpaid themselves, despite earlier disputing the fee. Tesla's
chief accounting officer Vaibhav Taneja said the company paid
the fee on February 11.
    Tesla is still appealing Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick's
January decision awarding the fees, court records show. The fee
award was the fourth-largest in the history of shareholder
litigation in Delaware. 
    A Tesla spokesperson did not immediately respond to a
request for comment, nor did the plaintiffs' lawyers at Fields
Kupka & Shukurov, McCarter & English and Bleichmar Fonti & Auld.
    The carmaker has argued the fee should be capped at $64
million, while the plaintiffs' lawyers sought $230 million.
    
-- Financial disclosures by officials tapped to join the Trump
administration show that Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher's David
Fotouhi, Trump's pick to serve as the second-in-charge at the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, reported earning at least
$3.2 million in fees representing clients including Chevron,
Ford and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
    Trump's choice for deputy secretary of state, Christopher
Landau, is collecting $378,341 a year in annual retirement
benefits from his former law firm Kirkland & Ellis, according to
his financial disclosure. 
    Landau resigned from Kirkland in 2018, after more than 25
years at the firm. He then was employed at Quinn Emanuel and
more recently at law firm Ellis George.
        In another new financial disclosure, Trump's pick to
lead the Justice Department's civil rights division, Harmeet
Dhillon, listed her legal services to clients, including Musk's
X Corp, conservative media star Tucker Carlson and the
Republican National Committee. 
    Dhillon said she would sell her stake in her firm Dhillon
Law Group to her brother, a partner at the small firm.

2025-02-27 15:39:44,"MORNING BID ASIA-Yields, stocks sag as 'Tariff Man' flexes muscles, Nvidia reports",urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250226:nL5N3PH2LG:5,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"By Jamie McGeever
       Feb 27 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian
markets. 
     
The Asia-Pacific economic and corporate calendar is virtually
empty on Thursday, allowing investors to take their cue from
global drivers, two of which stand out above all others -
Nvidia's earnings and U.S. President Donald Trump's latest
musings on tariffs.
    Nvidia <NVDA.O> reported fourth-quarter earnings after the
market close on Wednesday. Revenue grew 78% to $39.3 billion,
beating estimates of $38.04 billion, and the firm's forecast for
first-quarter revenue was also above market estimates. Shares in
the artificial intelligence poster child were little changed in
choppy, after-hours trading. 
Shares in Wall Street's 'Magnificent Seven' and Big Tech more
broadly - the runaway market winners over the last two years -
have been under heavy pressure this year as investors rotate
into unloved sectors at home and cheaper markets abroad.
Indeed, the 'Mag 7' this week entered correction territory
having fallen more than 10% from their recent peak, so recovery
hopes rested almost exclusively on Nvidia. Tech bulls may be
disappointed.
     
     
Also in U.S. tech, Tesla <TSLA.O> shares have shed nearly 20% in
less than a week, slammed on the news that the electric car
maker's sales in Europe nearly halved last month. Some analysts
suggest the slump was due to frustration in Europe about CEO
Elon Musk's close ties to Trump and political involvement in
European countries' domestic affairs. 
    Investors were on the defensive before Nvidia's results,
after Trump said earlier that he will soon announce a 25% tariff
on imports - ""on cars, and all of the things"" - from the
European Union. 
    Trump also said that steep new tariffs on imports from
Mexico and Canada will go ahead on April 2, a month later than
he had initially indicated. But a White House official later
clarified that the March 4 deadline remained in place ""as of
this moment"".
    'Tariff Man' is not for turning. Not yet anyway.
     
     
     
It was interesting to note that although Wall Street opened
firmer on Wednesday and was recouping some of its losses from
earlier this week, Treasuries didn't budge. This suggests the
fleeting equity rebound was more short-covering than anything
else, and that the bond market wasn't changing its view. 
But bond investors did react to Trump's tariff remarks. The
renewed decline in yields suggests they believe escalating trade
tensions will hit growth more than they will stoke inflation. At
least in the near term.
Most equity markets in Asia, except Japan, posted solid gains on
Wednesday. But the region is set to slide into the red at the
open on Thursday as investors play safe. Treasuries up, dollar
up - the big macro moves in U.S. regular trading hours on
Wednesday don't get much safer. 
    Here are key developments that could provide more direction
to Asian markets on Thursday:
    - Fallout from Trump's latest tariff threats 
    - G20 finance ministers, central bank governors meeting 
    - U.S. GDP (Q4, second estimate)

 (Updates with details on Xiaomi's aim to compete against Tesla
and Porsche, background)
       BEIJING, Feb 27 (Reuters) - China's Xiaomi <1810.HK> on
Thursday slashed its initial sticker price for its luxury
electric sedan SU7 Ultra by over a third to 529,900 yuan
($72,931.72), mounting a bigger challenge to the likes of Tesla
<TSLA.O> and Porsche <PSHG_p.DE> in the world's largest auto
market. 
    The Chinese electronics manufacturer turned automaker
started taking pre-orders for the car at the end of October at a
sticker price of 814,900 yuan, but CEO Lei Jun said at the car's
official launch in Beijing on Thursday that it was now cutting
that price by 35%.
    Lei said drivers of BMW 5 series, Audi A6 and Mercedes-Benz
E-class cars were showing interest in the SU7 Ultra but thought
it was a bit too expensive, as their cars sold for 500,000 and
600,000 yuan. 
        ""Our mission is that we should let more people who like
us afford luxury cars. Then after discussions for three to four
months, we’ve decided on the price of 529,900 yuan.""
    After the event, Xiaomi said it had received 6,900 orders
for the car within 10 minutes. 
        Xiaomi entered China's crowded EV market last year with
the launch of its hit SU7, a Porsche lookalike starting at less
than $30,000. The SU7 outsold Tesla's Model 3 in the fourth
quarter of last year, a trend that has been extended to 2025. 
    The SU7 Ultra was initially priced to be on par with the
Tesla Model S Plaid, that sells for 814,900 yuan ($114,200) in
China, and Xiaomi said in October that it outperformed the
Porsche Taycan Turbo in acceleration and top speed
specifications.
        The SU7 Ultra has more premium exterior and interior
materials, seats and audio speakers compared to other cheaper
SU7 models, Lei said. A limited-edition of the SU7 Ultra luxury
EV, whose specifications are yet to be disclosed, still sells
for 814,900 yuan.
    Buyers placing orders for the SU7 Ultra before the end of
March are entitled to perks including lifelong free access to
Xiaomi HAD end-to-end intelligent driving system that retails
for 26,000 yuan, said Lei.
    Lei also took aim at Tesla, making reference to the U.S.
carmaker's update to its autopilot software in China, which ""has
gone viral over the past two days, but still needs (users) to
pay more than 60,000 yuan,"" he said.
    The Tesla update disappointed some Tesla owners who
complained on social media that it fell short of CEO Elon Musk's
promises to bring full Autopilot and FSD systems to China.

    By Jonathan  Guilford
       NEW YORK, Feb 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General
Motors <GM.N> powered through bruising strikes, rampant supply
shortages and a distressing spike in interest rates to generate
three times as much cash and become the second-biggest U.S.
seller of electric vehicles, behind Tesla <TSLA.O>. To ease the
sting of the latest gloomy signs, boss Mary Barra is turning
back to the same section in her manual: return capital to
shareholders.
Nearly two years ago, after the United Auto Workers went on
strike and GM’s costly EV transition sputtered, Barra unveiled a
plan to buy back $10 billion of stock and sweetened the
dividend. In 2024, the Chevrolet and Cadillac manufacturer
trimmed its promised battery-powered production levels and then
set up a new $6 billion repurchase plan. GM now says it intends
to buy yet another $6 billion slug of shares and is lifting the
dividend 25%, to 15 cents.
Based on Tuesday’s closing price, the first $2 billion outlay,
set to happen immediately, should retire 4% of GM’s available
equity, lifting earnings per share and in turn the stock price.
The decision reflects the company’s ability to chug along even
as rival Ford Motor <F.N> occasionally misfired. Cash flow from
GM’s automotive operations, less capital expenditures, more than
tripled between 2018 and 2024.
    At just 4 times expected earnings over the next 12 months,
though, the shares are trading below the 5 times to 6 times they
garnered before the pandemic, per LSEG. New potholes always
spring up. Chief among them now is President Donald Trump’s
threatened 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Only 63% of GM’s
North American vehicle assembly occurs at home, the lowest of
the Motor City trio, analysts at Jefferies reckon. Barra
guesstimates that about half of trade levies can be offset. The
optimistic take is that they may not be implemented anyway.
Vehicle buyers are also increasingly failing to pay back loans
promptly. The share of borrowers late by 30 days or more has
grown past pre-Covid-19 norms, based on data from the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York. The silver lining is that, at less
than 2% for the in-house automotive finance operations, stress
levels are running lower than at large banks and other
specialized lenders.
    Curbs to EV subsidies also could hurt GM, however. Barra’s
latest buyback has no expiration date and it also can be
adjusted, but the company is nevertheless sending cash to
shareholders just as costs threaten to rise. It’s a celebration
of the good times before they roll to a stop.

 (Updates Feb. 26 story with Frankfurt-listed shares)
    By Aditya Soni, Noel Randewich and Rae Wee
       Feb 27 (Reuters) - Nvidia's <NVDA.O> quarterly outlook
on Wednesday suggested demand from Microsoft <MSFT.O>, Amazon
<AMZN.O> and other heavyweight tech companies racing to build
out AI infrastructure remains robust, though the outcome failed
to significantly quell fears of overspending in the booming
industry.
    Shares of Nvidia edged down 0.18% in Frankfurt on Thursday,
having fallen 1.5% in extended trade in New York on Wednesday
after the dominant AI chipmaker forecast quarterly revenue above
analysts' estimates. Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms <META.O>
and Alphabet <GOOGL.O>, among Nvidia's largest customers, were
mostly unchanged.
    Shares of those companies, among the components of the
so-called ""Magnificent Seven"", have delivered big returns as
they raced to dominate emerging AI technology following the
debut of ChatGPT in November 2022. 
    More recently, most of those stocks have stumbled and
investors have become more cautious, especially after China's
DeepSeek said it achieved significant AI performance at low
cost. 
    While Nvidia delivered a 78% surge in quarterly revenue, it
said its first-quarter margin would tighten to about 71% from
73.5%, lower than the 72.2% estimated by analysts, as it ramps
production of its new flagship Blackwell AI chips.
    ""Despite market jitters over DeepSeek's efficient model and
early Blackwell deployment challenges, Nvidia's results reaffirm
that it continues to lead the AI landscape,"" said Jacob Bourne,
an analyst at eMarketer. ""Competitors are making strides but
frontier models require the kind of advanced computing resources
that Nvidia provides."" 
    Still, the highly anticipated earnings report from Nvidia
was met with lacklustre response from technology companies in
Asia on Thursday.
    Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC)
<2330.TW>, Nvidia's main supplier of chips, slipped 0.47%, while
South Korean chipmakers Samsung Electronics <005930.KS> and SK
Hynix <000660.KS> fell 0.18% and 1%, respectively.
    Tokyo's Nikkei technology sub-index was up 0.2%.
    ""Nvidia's earnings came with much less volatility than
expected. The absence of major surprises may have kept sentiment
relatively calm,"" said Yeap Jun Rong, a market strategist at IG.
    
    LOSING SHINE
    The launch of low-cost AI models from DeepSeek last month
raised fears of a pullback in spending on Nvidia's priciest AI
chips and evaporated more than half a trillion dollars of its
stock market value in a single day, a record on Wall Street. 
    Adding to worries, an analyst report suggested Microsoft was
scrapping some data center leases.
    The Magnificent Seven stocks have retreated from their
late-2024 peaks and the group is in correction territory, with
the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF <MAGS.K> down more than 11%
from its December 17 closing high. 
   
    

    Nvidia has routinely exceeded analyst estimates over the
last two years, but the magnitude of its revenue beats has
narrowed as it faces tough comparisons from strong growth a year
ago. 
    ""DeepSeek rattled investors but given Nvidia's first-mover
advantage and the huge infrastructure investment plans from tech
giants like Meta, it's an indication that Nvidia's high-end
chips will remain in demand,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of
money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.
     Magnificent Seven stocks added roughly $11 trillion in
market capitalization between the debut of ChatGPT in November
2022 and their combined peak in mid-December 2024, with Nvidia
adding $2.7 trillion in market value, making it the world's
second-most valuable company at $3.2 trillion.
    Nvidia's stock has surged around 1,800% in the last five
years. Magnificent Seven stocks on average more than tripled in
that time, while the benchmark S&P 500 has gained about 65%.

2025-02-26 23:11:41,"Short sellers are ignoring recent dip in Nvidia's stocks, S3 says",urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250226:nL2N3PH1GG:3,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"By Chibuike Oguh
       NEW YORK, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The recent volatility in
Nvidia's <NVDA.O> stock has made it the riskiest short position
among the biggest technology heavyweight equities, surpassing
those of Tesla <TSLA.O>, according to a report released on
Wednesday by financial analytics firm S3 Partners.
    Last month, investor worries that the emergence of a
low-cost artificial intelligence model backed by Chinese startup
DeepSeek would threaten the dominance of Nvidia, triggered a
selloff in tech stocks that wiped out nearly $600 billion in the
chipmaker's value.
    Unlike in the past, short sellers did not react to the 15%
selloff in Nvidia's shares, breaking its historical correlation,
said S3 Partners, adding that ""with short interest lower and
earnings approaching, Nvidia could see a post-earnings rebound,
though volatility remains elevated.""
    After the closing bell, Nvidia reported fourth-quarter
results that beat analyst estimates with revenue jumping 78% to
$39.3 billion, compared with estimates of $38.04 billion. The
company's adjusted per-share profit of 89 cents was also ahead
of estimates of 84 cents a share. 
    Its current quarter revenue forecast was also higher than
expectations, signaling continued strong demand for artificial
intelligence chips.
    Nvidia's shares gyrated in after-hours trade following the
report, initially rallying about 1%, then turning 0.5% lower and
were last up 1.7% at $133.5. They had closed up 3.7% to $131.28
in regular hours and were down 2.2% year-to-date.

2025-02-26 21:18:41,Tesla wins ruling to limit damages in US lawsuit over Autopilot crash,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250226:nL2N3PH176:9,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"By Mike Scarcella
       Feb 26 (Reuters) - Elon Musk’s Tesla convinced a Florida
appeals court on Wednesday to limit the damages it could be
forced to pay in a wrongful death lawsuit accusing the electric
vehicle company of misstating the capabilities of its cars’
Autopilot system.
    The 4th District Court of Appeal in Palm Beach overturned a
judge’s decision from 2023 that said a jury could award punitive
damages, not just compensatory damages, in the lawsuit filed by
the estate of Jeremy Banner.
    Punitive damages are designed to punish intentional
misconduct and gross negligence, and they can be much larger
than those for compensatory damages, which account for medical
expenses, lost income and other factors.
    Tesla and attorneys for the plaintiffs did not immediately
respond to requests for comment.
    The appeals court said the evidence in Banner’s case
“indicates Tesla’s Autopilot features were ‘state-of-the-art’
and complied with all industry and regulatory standards.” 
    Banner, 50, was driving a Tesla Model 3 when he was killed
in 2019 in a crash near Miami. His Tesla drove at full speed and
struck the underside of a tractor-trailer that turned onto a
road in front of his car, court records show. The crash sheared
the Tesla's roof.
    Banner’s estate blamed his death on Tesla’s Autopilot driver
assistant system. Tesla has denied any wrongdoing, saying Banner
was at fault. Banner, according to Tesla, failed to heed
warnings about the limitations of his car’s Autopilot system.
    Lawyers for Banner’s estate previously told Reuters that
“the jury should be able to punish a company such as Tesla that
clearly has made the decision to put profits before safety.”
    They argued that Tesla knew its vehicles’ Autopilot was a
defective system, unsuitable on roads with cross-traffic.
    The appeals court said “Tesla cannot be liable for failing
to provide technology that it did not advertise and that did not
exist.”
    The trial in Banner's lawsuit was on hold pending Tesla's
appeal.
    
    The case is Tesla v Kim Banner, 4th District Court of
Appeal, State of Florida, No. 4D2023-3034.

    By Caroline Valetkevitch
       NEW YORK, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 will finish
2025 up about 9% from now, but volatility will likely increase
as a barrage of tariff announcements, job cuts and policy
changes from President Donald Trump fuels uncertainty, according
to equity strategists in a Reuters poll.
    The year-end target of 6,500 for the benchmark S&P 500
<.SPX>, the median forecast of 54 equity strategists, analysts,
brokers and portfolio managers collected February 13-25 is
unchanged from a Reuters equity poll in November.
    That is 9% above Tuesday's close of 5,955.25.
    The index is up 1.3% so far in 2025 following two straight
years of gains exceeding 20%, helped largely by gains in megacap
tech companies like Nvidia <NVDA.O> dominating the race for
artificial intelligence technology.
    Strategists said they expect solid corporate earnings growth
to continue to support gains in equities and they see a possible
boost to the economy if Trump, who took office on January 20,
goes ahead with his pro-growth agenda for tax cuts and
deregulation.
    But they say tariffs threaten to add inflationary pressures
at a time when the Federal Reserve has paused its rate-cutting
cycle.
    ""The economy is growing, inflation has been sticky but it's
much lower than it was just six months or a year ago, and
corporate profits are growing,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief
market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan,
which has a 6,500 ""base case"" year-end forecast for the S&P 500.
    ""What could derail some of that are the tariffs. That, to
us, is the biggest known unknown for markets and investors,"" he
said, noting that for now investors may be viewing the tariff
announcements as ""a negotiating tactic.""
Trump has rolled out a new 10% levy on all Chinese imports and
announced tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports.
He said on Monday his proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada were
still set to start next week, and has said he plans to introduce
25% tariffs on autos, semiconductors and pharmaceutical
imports.    
More recently, worries about a slowdown have emerged. Data on
Tuesday showed U.S. consumer confidence deteriorated at its
sharpest pace in 3-1/2 years in February while 12-month
inflation expectations jumped.
Also, thousands of U.S. government workers have been fired in
recent weeks as part of Trump's plan to reduce the federal
workforce, although those losses have mostly not appeared yet in
formal measures of the U.S. job market. 
    The cuts are being carried out under the direction of Tesla
Chief Executive Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.
    Moreover, Trump has verbally supported Russia as he has
pushed for a deal to end Russia's conflict with Ukraine, and has
denounced the Ukrainian president as a dictator, creating alarm
among some investors about relations between the U.S. and the
rest of the world.
    When asked whether a stock market correction of at least 10%
is likely in the coming three months, 13 of 19 poll participants
who answered the question said it was likely or highly likely,
while six said it was unlikely.
    ""Those with a short-term horizon, they could be a little
rattled by volatility. We just have so many unknowns as we start
2025,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at
Invesco in New York. She expects the S&P 500 to end this year at
6,360.
    Still, she said, ""policies are probably going to be less
important than what's fundamentally happening"", such as with
earnings.
    Analysts expect S&P 500 earnings growth of 11.1% in 2025,
compared with 11.7% in 2024, with growth for the final quarter
of 2024 set to be the highest since 2021, according to LSEG.
    Even after a choppy start to 2025, the S&P 500 is trading at
a multiple of about 22 times forward earnings, compared with a
10-year average price-to-earnings ratio of about 18, based on
LSEG data.
    Strategists continued to cite financials <.SPSY> as among
their top sector picks for 2025, partly because of prospects for
deregulation under Trump.
The poll has the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> finishing
this year at 47,024, up from 46,600 in the Reuters November
poll. The index closed at 43,621.16 on Tuesday.

    By Michael Martina and David Brunnstrom
       WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The Republican and
Democratic leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives' select
committee on China warned on Tuesday that Beijing may try to
exert leverage with Elon Musk in a bid to win favorable U.S.
policies, and that Washington must counter any such effort. 
    Republican committee chair John Moolenaar and Democratic
ranking member Raja Krishnamoorthi said they believed the 
Chinese Communist Party wants to use U.S. business leaders
including Musk, who have commercial interests in China, to
advance its goals in talks with Washington.
   ""To the question of Elon Musk, I do believe that the CCP will
try and leverage any opportunity,"" Moolenaar told an event
hosted by the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington.
    ""Are people going to be looking for that and make sure that
his lane is one that is not influencing China policy? I believe
that is the case,"" Moolenaar said, when asked whether Congress
has a role in preventing Beijing from negotiating with the White
House through Musk.        
    Musk and the White House did not respond immediately to
requests for comment. China's Washington embassy said China
welcomed ""mutually beneficial cooperation"" with ""people from all
walks of life in the United States."" 
        ""We are happy to see foreign-funded enterprises invest
and start businesses in China, deepen their presence in the
Chinese market and share development opportunities,"" embassy
spokesperson Liu Pengyu said by email.
  
    China has some pressing priorities. Just over a month into
his second term, President Donald Trump has announced additional
10% tariffs on Chinese goods, called for greater restrictions on
Chinese investment in the U.S., and named China hardliners to
key posts. 
    Musk, the world's richest man and among Trump's biggest
donors in the 2024 election, could be attractive to Beijing as a
potential conduit to Trump because he has become one of the
president's closest White House advisers.
    Trump named Musk to lead an effort to radically downsize the
federal government. 
    The billionaire also for years has had contact with senior
Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping.
        China may also be able to grant Musk things that he
wants. His biggest business interest in China is electric car
company Tesla, which he leads as CEO. Tesla delivered 36.7% of
its cars to customers in China last year, its second-largest
market worldwide based on sales.
    But Tesla's market share has declined in China as domestic
electric vehicle makers have grown, and it has faced regulatory
roadblocks to the rollout of its self-driving features there
that could boost sales while regulators have allowed Chinese
firms to move ahead. 
    Apart from Tesla, some of Musk's other ventures, including
commercial rocket and satellite firm SpaceX and social media
platform X - the latter is banned in China - are viewed by
Beijing as security risks.
    
    CIRCUMVENTING CHINA HAWKS 
    Krishnamoorthi told the Brookings event that Beijing viewed
Musk as way to circumvent China hawks on Trump's national
security team, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and
national security adviser Mike Waltz. 
    ""They absolutely see him as an asset to them in any kind of
negotiations, a way to bypass Rubio, a way to bypass Waltz, a
way to bypass those whom they see to be less friendly to them on
their issues,"" Krishnamoorthi said.
    ""My hope is that the president is going to be listening to
everybody very carefully,"" he said. 
    The lawmakers did not detail the evidence supporting their
views. 
    The White House has said Musk has no decision-making
authority in the Trump administration and his efficiency
initiative has no direct involvement in U.S. foreign policy.
    Trump's praise for Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin
have stoked concerns that he might pursue a grand bargain with
Beijing that sidelines Taiwan. China claims the island as its
territory, and Taipei has historically counted on Washington as
its most important backer, a major irritant to China.  
    Krishnamoorthi said he worried Trump could put core U.S.
interests, such as support for Taiwan or freedom of navigation
in the South China Sea, up for negotiation in any direct talks
with Xi to achieve wins on trade.
    Moolenaar said he had confidence in Trump's national
security team, but also ""limited hopes"" for what talks with
China might achieve given Beijing's failure to live up to past
promises.

    By Zaheer Kachwala
       Feb 25 (Reuters) - Electric-vehicle maker Lucid Group
<LCID.O> said on Tuesday that Peter Rawlinson, its CEO for over
5 years, is stepping down from the role, and forecast its
vehicle production will more than double this year, sending the
company's shares up 10% in extended trading. 
    Through his 12-year tenure as part of the top brass at
Lucid, Rawlinson helped launch the company's Air models and
guided it through its public offering. 
    The company's operating chief, Marc Winterhoff, will take
the position of interim CEO. 
    ""Now that we have successfully launched the Lucid Gravity, I
have decided it is finally the right time for me to step aside
from my roles at Lucid,"" Rawlinson said.
    The firm also forecast vehicle production this year to be
around 20,000, compared with around 9,000 cars it made in 2024.
    Andres Sheppard, senior equity analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald,
said the CEO transition is ""surprising"" but not unexpected given
the company's previous underperformances, adding that the
production forecast is ""encouraging.""
    The company hired veteran finance professional Taoufiq
Boussaid as its chief financial officer last month. Boussaid
previously helped reduce debt load for his former company.
    As the EV demand in the United States remains uncertain,
Lucid has been trying to diversify its product lineup and step
into the SUV market with the Gravity model, going toe-to-toe
with Tesla's <TSLA.O> model X and Rivian's <RIVN.O> R1S
vehicles. 
    The success of the Gravity SUV is seen as crucial to Lucid's
long-term outlook, as it burns through cash ramping up
production while its Air sedans have seen price cuts due to
slower demand.
    ""They (Lucid) still have an amazing product. Now it's just a
matter of can they turn the company around, can they increase
demand and production with the Gravity, and really that's going
to bridge the gap to their mid-size vehicle in 2026,"" Sheppard
said. 
    Analysts on the post-earnings conference noted that
Rawlinson was absent from the call, sparking questions about the
circumstances surrounding his exit from the role. 
    ""I definitely think it was surprising and unusual that he
wasn't present during the call, particularly since they didn't
appoint the new CEO,"" said Sheppard, who was also present on the
call.
    The company continues to lose tens of thousands of dollars
per vehicle, while rivals such as Rivian move aggressively to
cut costs in a bid to make profits.
    Lucid reported revenue of $234.5 million, beating Wall
Street expectations of $214.2 million, according to data
compiled by LSEG. 
    It posted a loss of $397.2 million in the quarter ended
December 31, compared with a loss of $653.8 million a year ago.
 
    Demand for pure battery cars in the U.S. has been slow as
people gravitate more towards cheaper hybrids owing to high
interest rates and economic uncertainty.

2025-02-25 23:00:10,RPT-ANALYSIS-South Korea political turmoil pushes companies to take tariff matters into their own hands,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250225:nL2N3PG08V:3,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"(Repeats story from late on Tuesday with no changes to text)
    By Hyunjoo Jin
       SEOUL, Feb 25 (Reuters) - South Korea's business leaders
are taking action to offset the threat posed by U.S. President
Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies, hiring his former
aides and lobbying Republican states out of frustration with
delays by their own government which is mired in a political
crisis.
    Trump's sweeping and sometimes indiscriminate trade measures
have sparked existential debate in many international capitals
over how much they can depend on the U.S. from trade to
politics.
    While it remains to be seen how the upheaval may affect the
long-standing alliance and close economic relationship between
Washington and Seoul, the stakes are higher for South Korea than
other countries, as it grapples with the worst political crisis
in decades after impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly
imposed martial law on December 3.
    Yoon's policy to grow more closely aligned with Washington
amid trade tensions between China and the U.S. has also
increased South Korea's reliance on the U.S. market, which
accounted fornearly 20% of its total exports last year, leaving
its businesses more vulnerable to potential tariff changes.
    ""We are frustrated,"" an executive at a major business
conglomerate said, asking not to be identified due to the
sensitivity of the subject.
    The executive said the government has not discussed any
concrete plans to bring Trump to the negotiating table at
meetings it held with corporate representatives. 
    South Korean companies are also worried that they do not
have enough backing from the government, when leaders of other
countries including Japan and India have already met Trump and
seek to stave off damaging U.S. tariffs, company officials said.
    South Korea's Acting President Choi Sang-mok has yet to
speak directly with Trump, and told lawmakers earlier this month
that there are restrictions in the way the acting leadership can
respond to U.S. tariff system changes. He said Korea can
leverage its U.S. investments and energy imports in potential
negotiations. 
        South Korea's industry minister will 
    travel
     to the U.S. this week to press again for an exemption from
steel tariffs and discuss ways to boost cooperation in energy
and shipbuilding, the ministry said on Tuesday.
  
    Amid uncertainty over how quickly the domestic political
crisis would end, the country's business association sent a
delegation of executives from major companies such as Samsung,
LG, SK and Hyundai Motor to Washington last week and met U.S.
Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, two sources familiar with
the matter said.
    At the meeting, Lutnick encouraged investment in the U.S.,
according to one of the sources. It was not immediately clear
what the Korean delegation team had requested.
    Companies are also arranging separate meetings to connect
with U.S. government officials.
    ""We’re having dialogue with the new U.S. administration to
reinforce our significant investments, job creation and economic
impact,"" Jose Munoz, Hyundai Motor's former U.S. chief who was
promoted as the South Korean firm's first foreign CEO in
November, said in a letter to shareholders earlier this month.
    Hyundai also promoted Sung Kim, a former U.S. diplomat
during Trump's first term, to president in charge of global
government affairs in November.
    The company is looking to hold a car factory opening
ceremony in Georgia, three people familiar with the matter told
Reuters, with two of them saying the automaker is seeking to
invite Trump to the event.
    Autos, semiconductors and steel, which are being reviewed by
the Trump administration for import levies, are among South
Korea's major industries. 
    Hyundai said no decision has been made about the ceremony.
    The executive at a major business conglomerate said its
affiliates are also considering holding an outreach event in
Tennessee to tout their combined investments in the Republican
state as part of efforts to gain political influence at the
federal level.    
     
    IN A BIND
    Analysts expect a court decision to be made in March on
whether to oust Yoon or restore his presidential powers. If he's
removed from the office, an election to pick a new president
should be held within 60 days.
    In 2017, when Trump started his first term, then President
Park Geun-hye was going through an impeachment trial. 
    But the Trump administration moved more gradually with his
tariff policies, giving South Korea some time to maneuver, said
former trade minister Yeo Han-koo, helping it win an exemption
to steel tariffs in return for a quota that put a cap on export
volumes to the U.S.
    ""Now they are moving at lightning speed,"" Yeo said.
    A Seoul government official said it is ""having a lot of
difficulties,"" and there are concerns that the next president
may not follow through on commitments the current interim
government would make with the U.S., for example.
    Scott A. Snyder, president of the Korea Economic Institute
of America (KEI), a Washington-based think tank, said that a
major impediment is there is no leader-to-leader communication
between the two countries.
    ""That is something that just has to wait,"" he said, adding
it would be better for Korea ""to lie low and to avoid picking
its head up in many of these sectors.""

       WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The Republican and
Democratic leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives' select
committee on China warned on Tuesday that Beijing may try to
exert leverage with Elon Musk in a bid to win more favorable
U.S. policies, and Washington must counter any such effort. 
    Republican committee chair John Moolenaar and Democratic
ranking member Raja Krishnamoorthi said they believed the 
Communist Party of China wants to use U.S. business leaders
including Musk, who have commercial interests in China, to
advance its goals in talks with Washington.
   ""To the question of Elon Musk, I do believe that the CCP will
try and leverage any opportunity,"" Moolenaar told an event
hosted by the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington.
    ""Are people going to be looking for that and make sure that
his lane is one that is not influencing China policy? I believe

importance of their own national security,"" he said.

    By Mike Scarcella
       Feb 25 (Reuters) - A leading attorney for billionaire
Tesla <TSLA.O> CEO Elon Musk and embattled New York Mayor Eric
Adams now has a standard billing rate of $3,000 an hour, placing
him on the top shelf among even the priciest of Manhattan
lawyers.
    Alex Spiro, known for his high-profile clientele and
relentless litigation style, is among a small group of lawyers
at his law firm now billing the $3,000 rate, according to a
source familiar with the firm's billing practices. 
    Spiro's firm, 1,000-lawyer Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &
Sullivan, disclosed a range of new billing rates in court
filings in recent days. The source said the top rate applies to
Spiro and to William Burck, the firm’s global co-managing
partner.
    Top rates for the most in-demand U.S. lawyers have
skyrocketed in recent years, with the most senior partners
regularly charging more than $2,000 an hour and commanding
millions of dollars in annual pay.
    Law firms sometimes tailor individual rates for clients or
apply discounts. It was unclear how much Spiro or Burck are
charging specific clients.
A spokesperson for Los Angeles-founded Quinn Emanuel declined to
comment. In addition to Musk and Adams, the firm's clients
include Alphabet’s Google <GOOGL.O>. In January, the Trump
Organization said it had hired Burck as an outside ethics
adviser. Spokespeople for Musk, Adams and the companies did not
immediately respond to requests for comment.
Spiro has represented Musk in several lawsuits, including
defamation and shareholder cases and litigation brought by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He did not immediately
respond to a request for comment.
Spiro is currently defending Adams against criminal allegations
that the mayor took bribes from Turkish officials. Adams has
pleaded not guilty. 
    Burck, a longtime Republican insider, has defended Trump's
former political strategist Steve Bannon.
     
    RATES ON THE RISE
    Quinn Emanuel's $3,000 top rate marks a milestone for
leading U.S. law firms as lawyers' hourly fees continue to soar.
Law firms routinely raise their rates each year, and top rates
at some of the largest U.S. firms have pushed past $2,500 an
hour or higher in recent years, court records show. 
    Quinn Emanuel said in its court filings that its partners
now bill between $1,860 and $3,000 an hour. It said it will
charge between $1,775 and $2,725 an hour for “of counsel”
attorneys at the firm, and between $1,035 and $1,665 for
associates.
    Billing rate increases helped drive growing revenue and
profits for U.S. law firms in 2024, Wells Fargo's Legal
Specialty Group said in a recent report.
Clients have been willing to accept “dramatic increases” in
rates, according to a report last month by the Thomson Reuters
Institute and the Georgetown Law Center on Ethics and the Legal
Profession. The institute and Reuters share the same parent
company, Thomson Reuters.
    Court records show top rates at Quinn Emanuel have grown
about 34% since 2022, when partners billed up to $2,130 an hour.
    Quinn Emanuel disclosed last year that it earned more than
$2 billion in revenue in 2023, according to industry publication
The American Lawyer.

2025-02-25 18:32:59,Tesla's market value tumbles below $1 trillion as its Europe sales slump,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250225:nL2N3PG0U0:3,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"By Noel Randewich
       Feb 25 (Reuters) - Tesla's <TSLA.O> stock tumbled 8% on
Tuesday, pushing its market value below $1 trillion for the
first time since November after data showed the electric car
maker's sales slumped in Europe in January.
    The European Automobile Manufacturers Association reported
that Tesla sales dropped 45% in Europe, compared with a 37% jump
in overall sales of EVs in Europe.
    The sales decline underscores Tesla's challenges following a
dip in global deliveries last year that has raised pressure on
CEO Elon Musk to roll out lower-priced models as well as the
autonomous cars that he says underpin Tesla's future.
    
    Tesla shares dropped to $305, leaving the company with a
market capitalization of $981 billion, still over twice the
combined value of General Motors <GM.N>, Ford Motor <F.N>,
Volkswagen <VOWG.DO>, Toyota Motor <7203.T>, Hyundai Motor
<005380.KS> and BMW <BMWG.DE>.
    Some investors are also worried that Musk's role overseeing
a radical downsizing of the federal government, at the behest of
U.S. President Donald Trump, is potentially distracting his
attention from Tesla as well as damaging the company's brand
appeal to some consumers. Musk also heads privately held space
rocket maker SpaceX and other private companies.
    ""He's a very hands-on operator, and if you're spending that
much time in an office in the White House, how much time are you
spending running all of your other companies, including the one
that's publicly traded?"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist
at B. Riley Wealth in Boston.
    Concerns about potential over-investment in artificial
intelligence are also weighing on Tesla, as well as Microsoft
<MSFT.O> and Meta Platforms <META.O> ahead of AI chip
heavyweight Nvidia's <NVDA.O> quarterly report on Wednesday,
Hogan said.
    Tesla's stock recently traded at 112 times expected
earnings, above its five-year average PE of 93, according to
LSEG. By comparison, Ford's stock is valued at eight times
earnings, and GM's is at seven.  
    Tesla bulls point to the company's plan to launch a new,
cheaper electric vehicle and to Musk's promises to launch a paid
autonomous car service.
    With Tuesday's drop, Tesla shares remain up 51% over the
past 12 months. Year-to-date, the stock is down 24%.

       Feb 25 (Reuters) - 
    The tech-heavy Nasdaq led Wall Street declines on Tuesday,
hitting a six-week low after fresh economic data indicated a
deterioration in consumer sentiment and investors braced for the
potential impact of tighter U.S. trade curbs on Beijing.
  
        A Conference Board report showed an index tracking
consumer confidence stood at 98.3 in February compared with an
estimate of 102.5, according to economists polled by Reuters.
  
        Investors also focused on a 
    report that
     said the U.S. was planning further restrictions on Nvidia's
chip exports to China and that Washington was consulting with
allies about tightening chip controls on China.
        Nvidia <NVDA.O> dropped 2.9%. Other semiconductor stocks
also fell, with the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index
<.SOX> down 1.6%.
  
        ""I think for the (semiconductor) sector there's more
geopolitical risk and exposure, especially when you think about
China. That's one of the reasons that the sector has struggled
recently and is struggling year to date,"" said Kevin Gordon,
senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab.
  
    Nvidia's results on Wednesday will be crucial for technology
companies, as investors have questioned the industry's hefty
artificial-intelligence spends after low-cost competition from
China's DeepSeek rattled markets in January. The S&P 500
technology sector <.SPLRCT> is on track for its first quarterly
decline since July 2023, if losses hold.
        Most megacap stocks traded lower, with Microsoft
<MSFT.O> and Meta Platforms <META.O> down 0.8% and 1.8%,
respectively, while Tesla <TSLA.O> led losses with a 5.6%
decline.
  
        A gauge tracking investor fear <.VIX> spiked to touch
its highest in nearly a month, last up 1.44 points at 20.42.
    At 10:14 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI>
fell 78.98 points, or 0.18%, to 43,382.23, the S&P 500 <.SPX>
lost 45.07 points, or 0.75%, to 5,938.18, and the Nasdaq
Composite <.IXIC> lost 277.57 points, or 1.45%, to 19,007.96.
        Seven of the S&P 500's 11 sectors traded lower, with
technology stocks <.SPLRCT> leading losses with a 1.4% decline.
  
        Defensive sector consumer staples <.SPLRCS> led gains
with a 1.4% rise.
  
        Further tempering risk-taking, U.S. President Donald
Trump said late on Monday that tariffs on Canadian and Mexican
imports were ""on time and on schedule"" ahead of the March 4
deadline.

      Deal subject to merger control law, terms undisclosed
    

  
       BERLIN, Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. carmaker Tesla <TSLA.O>
will acquire parts of the insolvent German high-tech parts maker
Manz AG <M5ZG.DE>, including more than 300 employees at its site
in Reutlingen city in the southwest, the German company said on
Tuesday. 
    The deal marks a wider presence by Tesla in Germany, where
it runs a manufacturing site near Berlin, even after CEO Elon
Musk endorsed the far-right party AfD, which mainstream parties
have refused to work with due to its extreme positions.
     Tesla sold almost 60% fewer cars in Germany in January than
a year earlier, as the U.S. electric vehicle maker faces a test
of popularity amid Musk's U.S. political involvement.
    Manz's insolvency administrator and Tesla Automation GmbH, a
subsidiary of the U.S. company, signed a purchase agreement on
Monday, the German company said.
    The parties agreed not to disclose a purchase price, and
completion of the transaction is subject to merger control law.
    Tesla Automation, which specializes in the construction of
special-purpose machines at three German locations, plans to
take over more than 300 employees, acquire movable tangible
assets, and use Manz's property in Reutlingen.
    Approximately 100 employees will lose their jobs and not be
transferred to Tesla Automation, according to Manz.
    Insolvency administrator Martin Mucha said the structured
sales process for other assets was moving forward.
    ""We are currently holding promising talks with several
interested parties,"" added Mucha in a statement.

2025-02-25 10:23:07,UPDATE 1-European car sales drop in January as falling combustion engines outweigh EV gains,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250225:nL2N3PG0A6:1,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"(Adds Tesla and SAIC figures in paragraph 2, graphics)
    By Alessandro Parodi
       Feb 25 (Reuters) - 
    Sales of fully electric car sales In Europe were up 37.3% in
January, industry data showed on Tuesday, although the sharp
rise was not enough to compensate for a drop in petrol and
diesel vehicles, leaving overall sales down by 2.1%.
  
        Figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers
Association (ACEA) showed that all-electric brand Tesla <TSLA.O>
saw a 45.2% drop in the European Union, Britain and the European
Free Trade Area, while sales at its Chinese competitor SAIC
Motor <600104.SS>, which owns the MG brand, were up 36.8%.

    WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
    The EU executive will present auto sector plans on March 5,
following talks with automakers, unions and interest groups.
    EU carmakers, which are struggling to compete with Chinese
rivals and bracing for U.S. tariffs, are urging the Commission
to grant relief from potential fines resulting from CO2 car
emission targets that came into effect in January.
    Some automakers have increased the prices of petrol engine
models to encourage EV adoption, but the industry fears that
customers will simply buy fewer cars.
    Electric transport groups, instead, claim that any push to
weaken the targets will disrupt investments in EV infrastructure
and hamper the bloc's competitiveness.
    
    BY THE NUMBERS 
    January sales in the EU, Britain and EFTA fell slightly
below 1 million cars sold, the lowest volume since August. 
    Registrations at Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> and Renault
<RENA.PA> grew by 5.3% and 5.4% respectively, while they fell by
16% at Stellantis <STLAM.MI>.
    
    
    In the EU, January sales fell by 2.6%, even as the
registrations of battery electric (BEV) and hybrid electric
(HEV) cars grew by 34% and 18.4% respectively. Plug-in hybrids
(PHEVs) sales were instead down by 8.5%.
    Electrified vehicles - either BEV, HEV or PHEV - sold in the
bloc accounted for 57.2% of passenger car registrations in
January, up from 47.4% in the previous year.
    
    
    Among the largest EU markets, Spain sales increased by 5.3%,
while in France, Italy and Germany they dropped by 6.2%, 5.8%
and 2.8%. In Britain they were down 2.5%.
    
    CONTEXT
    While battling to bring down high costs in home markets and
fighting competition from China, European carmakers are also
preparing to face potential import tariffs imposed by U.S.
President Donald Trump.
    Trump has raised tariffs on aluminium and steel and
threatened a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, as
well as on all autos and semiconductors.

2025-02-25 08:59:17,ANALYSIS-South Korea political turmoil pushes companies to take tariff matters into their own hands,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250225:nL3N3P90JI:1,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"By Hyunjoo Jin
       SEOUL, Feb 25 (Reuters) - South Korea's business leaders
are taking action to offset the threat posed by U.S. President
Donald Trump's aggressive trade policies, hiring his former
aides and lobbying Republican states out of frustration with
delays by their own government which is mired in a political
crisis.
    Trump's sweeping and sometimes indiscriminate trade measures
have sparked existential debate in many international capitals
over how much they can depend on the U.S. from trade to
politics.
    While it remains to be seen how the upheaval may affect the
long-standing alliance and close economic relationship between
Washington and Seoul, the stakes are higher for South Korea than
other countries, as it grapples with the worst political crisis
in decades after impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly
imposed martial law on December 3.
    Yoon's policy to grow more closely aligned with Washington
amid trade tensions between China and the U.S. has also
increased South Korea's reliance on the U.S. market, which
accounted fornearly 20% of its total exports last year, leaving
its businesses more vulnerable to potential tariff changes.
    ""We are frustrated,"" an executive at a major business
conglomerate said, asking not to be identified due to the
sensitivity of the subject.
    The executive said the government has not discussed any
concrete plans to bring Trump to the negotiating table at
meetings it held with corporate representatives. 
    South Korean companies are also worried that they do not
have enough backing from the government, when leaders of other
countries including Japan and India have already met Trump and
seek to stave off damaging U.S. tariffs, company officials said.
    South Korea's Acting President Choi Sang-mok has yet to
speak directly with Trump, and told lawmakers earlier this month
that there are restrictions in the way the acting leadership can
respond to U.S. tariff system changes. He said Korea can
leverage its U.S. investments and energy imports in potential
negotiations. 
        South Korea's industry minister will 
    travel
     to the U.S. this week to press again for an exemption from
steel tariffs and discuss ways to boost cooperation in energy
and shipbuilding, the ministry said on Tuesday.
  
    Amid uncertainty over how quickly the domestic political
crisis would end, the country's business association sent a
delegation of executives from major companies such as Samsung,
LG, SK and Hyundai Motor to Washington last week and met U.S.
Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, two sources familiar with
the matter said.
    At the meeting, Lutnick encouraged investment in the U.S.,
according to one of the sources. It was not immediately clear
what the Korean delegation team had requested.
    Companies are also arranging separate meetings to connect
with U.S. government officials.
    ""We’re having dialogue with the new U.S. administration to
reinforce our significant investments, job creation and economic
impact,"" Jose Munoz, Hyundai Motor's former U.S. chief who was
promoted as the South Korean firm's first foreign CEO in
November, said in a letter to shareholders earlier this month.
    Hyundai also promoted Sung Kim, a former U.S. diplomat
during Trump's first term, to president in charge of global
government affairs in November.
    The company is looking to hold a car factory opening
ceremony in Georgia, three people familiar with the matter told
Reuters, with two of them saying the automaker is seeking to
invite Trump to the event.
    Autos, semiconductors and steel, which are being reviewed by
the Trump administration for import levies, are among South
Korea's major industries. 
    Hyundai said no decision has been made about the ceremony.
    The executive at a major business conglomerate said its
affiliates are also considering holding an outreach event in
Tennessee to tout their combined investments in the Republican
state as part of efforts to gain political influence at the
federal level.    
     
    IN A BIND
    Analysts expect a court decision to be made in March on
whether to oust Yoon or restore his presidential powers. If he's
removed from the office, an election to pick a new president
should be held within 60 days.
    In 2017, when Trump started his first term, then President
Park Geun-hye was going through an impeachment trial. 
    But the Trump administration moved more gradually with his
tariff policies, giving South Korea some time to maneuver, said
former trade minister Yeo Han-koo, helping it win an exemption
to steel tariffs in return for a quota that put a cap on export
volumes to the U.S.
    ""Now they are moving at lightning speed,"" Yeo said.
    A Seoul government official said it is ""having a lot of
difficulties,"" and there are concerns that the next president
may not follow through on commitments the current interim
government would make with the U.S., for example.
    Scott A. Snyder, president of the Korea Economic Institute
of America (KEI), a Washington-based think tank, said that a
major impediment is there is no leader-to-leader communication
between the two countries.
    ""That is something that just has to wait,"" he said, adding
it would be better for Korea ""to lie low and to avoid picking
its head up in many of these sectors.""

 (Adds comment from Musk on Tesla using videos of Chinese
streets to train its software, in last paragraph)
       SHANGHAI, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Tesla <TSLA.O> on Tuesday
made a long-awaited update to its autopilot software in China to
add a city navigation feature, but the move disappointed Chinese
owners who said it fell short of Elon Musk's promises. 
    The U.S. electric vehicle maker, in a notification on its
app, said capabilities will include automatic lane-changing
depending on speed and route as well as detecting traffic lights
at intersections and deciding whether to turn. An in-car camera
will also monitor driver attention, it said.    
    The features are similar to those available with Tesla's
""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD) but less advanced than what are
available in the United States due to insufficient data training
on Chinese roads and traffic rules, a person with direct
knowledge of the matter said.
    FSD is a suite of driving-assistance technologies developed
with generative artificial intelligence to cope with more
complicated traffic conditions whereas Autopilot handles more
routine conditions. 
    Musk wants to bring full Autopilot and FSD systems to China
but has said that the effort was proving to be tricky due to
technology restrictions imposed by both the U.S. and Chinese
governments. The company has postponed an initial goal of
end-2024 to this year. 
    Several Chinese social media users said the update was a
disappointment as it did not achieve the capabilities Tesla has
advertised for years and said rival Chinese automakers were
offering similar driver-assistance features at a lower price or
for free. 
    Lu Panpan, a Tesla car owner in China's eastern Zhejiang
province, said he paid 56,000 yuan ($7,720) for FSD software
when he bought his Long Range Model 3 in 2019 but has been
frustrated by the lack of updates to its features. 
    ""We can tell Tesla has no choice but to deliver a knowingly
restricted system ... ,"" said Lu. ""It is hard for Tesla to catch
up with the smart-driving capabilities in Chinese cars, which
even makes less sense given its high pricing.""
     
    FALLING BEHIND
    The delays to rolling out a full FSD system in China have
left Tesla on the back foot versus Chinese rivals such as
Huawei, Xiaomi and BYD, which have launched dozens of EVs with
advanced smart-driving software capable of navigating through
China's complicated city traffic. 
    Tesla charges its customers an additional fee of nearly
$9,000 to access a limited version of its FSD software in its
EVs priced from $32,000. 
    By comparison, Xiaomi <1810.HK>, whose SU7 electric sedan
priced from $29,700 has outsold Tesla's Model 3 in China on
monthly basis, offers an enhanced smart-driving system including
city navigation for free.
    Earlier this month, BYD also started offering advanced
autonomous-driving features on most of its models for free,
including ones priced as low as $9,555. 
    Tesla's Autopilot update is on par with BYD's mid-tier
version of its God's Eye system, which uses advanced computing
and lidars to generate 3D images of a car's surroundings to
assist navigation around obstacles. It is offered in its premium
brand Denza and high-end models of its Dynasty and Ocean
series. 
    Musk has said that Tesla is seeking regulatory approval from
Beijing to fully roll out FSD in the country, but China
currently only requires automakers to register any level-two
update with the industry ministry. 
    Under industry standards, both Autopilot and FSD are
categorised as level-two autonomous driving technologies, so
under Chinese law they require human supervision and
intervention when necessary.
    Automakers only need to seek regulatory approval for more
advanced level-three and above autonomous driving features.
    Musk, however, wanted to be able to transfer data Tesla
vehicles glean in China abroad, which is heavily regulated under
China's data laws, Reuters reported previously. Such data, used
to train self-driving systems, would boost Tesla's long-term
efforts to produce fully autonomous vehicles. 
    As part of that effort, Tesla was also developing plans for
a data centre in China to train the algorithm needed for more
fully autonomous vehicles. 
        Tesla has been using videos of Chinese streets available
on the internet to train its AI software as the U.S. prohibits
on-site training in China, Musk said in an earnings briefing
last month.

       Feb 25 (Reuters) - India's benchmark indexes rose
marginally on Tuesday, helped by heavyweight financials and auto
stocks, although losses in metals and global uncertainty around
U.S. tariffs kept investors on the edge. 
    The Nifty 50 <.NSEI> rose 0.13% to 22,568 by 10:49 a.m. IST,
while the BSE Sensex <.BSESN> added 0.24% to 74,632.3.     
    Financials <.NIFTYFIN> gained 0.3% after shedding 2% over

    ""Emergence of some temporary buying interest in financials
has pushed benchmark indexes to the green, but we are not very
constructive of markets and sentiment turning positive anytime
soon,"" said Aishvarya Dadheech, chief investment officer of
Fident Asset Management.
    Risk sentiment in domestic equities has been weak in recent
months due to concerns around U.S. tariff plans and persistent
foreign outflows, along with slowing corporate earnings. 
    Gains on Tuesday were kept in check by a 1.1% drop in metals

demand due to U.S. tariffs. [MET/L]
    A stronger dollar makes commodities priced in the U.S.

        Indian markets are not expected to recover in a jiffy,
Fident Asset's Dadheech said, as uncertainty over trade policies

expressed are her own.)
    By Katrina Hamlin
       HONG KONG, Feb 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - At least
Makoto Uchida knows his turnaround plan for Nissan Motor
<7201.T> is worth something. The beleaguered $11 billion
Japanese carmaker’s CEO now has KKR <KKR.N> mulling an
investment, Bloomberg reported on the same day he officially
broke off merger talks with Honda <7267.T>. Foxconn <2317.TW> is
interested, as still, is Honda – if Uchida leaves, according to
the Financial Times. And now some Japanese bigwigs may want
Tesla <TSLA.O> to buy a stake, the FT reported on Friday.
There’s a clear prize: a successful overhaul could almost triple
Nissan’s valuation, Breakingviews calculates. Trouble is, it’s a
daunting risk-reward trade.
    Nissan's automotive unit has been leaking red ink, with a
roughly $1 billion operating loss in the first nine months of
this financial year. Shareholders appear to ascribe it a
negative value: the company's lending division alone is probably
worth some $12 billion, based on the average of 80% of book
value Japanese financial companies trade at, per Fitch.
    Assume Uchida hits his goal of boosting the carmaking arm's
operating margin to 4% for its March 2027 financial year. Using
estimates gathered by Visible Alpha of $77 billion in annual
revenue from selling 3.1 million vehicles, that'd bring in $3
billion. Lop off interest payments and 25% tax, and net profit
would be $2 billion. Apply a multiple of just over 7 times
earnings, the average for a basket of Japanese peers, and the
manufacturing business would be worth $14 billion.
    Such an improvement ought to bolster the finance unit, too,
so value it at its estimated March 2027 book value of almost $16
billion, per Visible Alpha. The combined entity could then
command a price tag of around $30 billion.
    Getting there from here is a tall order. It would require
proving that annual car sales will stabilise at around 3
million, having fallen to 3.4 million last year from almost 6
million in 2018. Uchida would also have to ensure that drivers
will on average pay 8% more for their Nissan than they do now.
The company has also been leaning on incentives to encourage
purchases.
    And he needs his plans to close factories and slash
headcount to both succeed and not be undone by rising costs
elsewhere. That could be hard: recent history shows Nissan's
expenses are sticky, and the company has to boost investment in
hybrid and electric vehicles. 
    External forces could make those requirements even harder.
If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's import tariffs
would hurt Nissan in its largest market; in its second-largest,
China, it and other foreign brands are losing share to local
rivals like BYD <002594.SZ> <1211.HK>.
    The prospect of finding synergies may give some potential
suitors more stomach for these risks than others: Honda has its
own auto unit, while KKR owns parts-maker Marelli, which counts
Nissan as a major customer. Whoever gets involved, though,
Uchida's company is in for a white-knuckle ride.

    CONTEXT NEWS
    A “high-level Japanese group” including Japan’s former prime
minister Yoshihide Suga and former Tesla board member Hiro
Mizuno has drawn up a proposal for Elon Musk’s Tesla to invest
in Nissan Motor, the Financial Times reported on February 21,
citing sources.
    Later on the same day, Reuters reported that Suga's office

Nissan, and that Mizuno said on social media that he had
""absolutely no involvement"" in what the FT had reported.
    Private equity firm KKR is considering an investment in
Nissan, Bloomberg reported on February 13, citing sources. The
talks are in early stages, according to the report.
    Honda Motor and Nissan ended talks regarding a possible

    On the same day, Nissan reported an operating profit of 31.1
billion yen ($202 million) in the three months to the end of
December, 78% lower than the same period in the previous year.
The company also lowered by 20% to 120 billion yen its forecast
operating profit for the current financial year, which runs to
the end of March.

    By David Shepardson
       WASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation
Department told workers they should respond to a demand by
President Donald Trump's adviser Elon Musk to list their
accomplishments in the past week by 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday.
    USDOT has a workforce of about 57,000 people that includes
the Federal Aviation Administration, National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration and Federal Railroad Administration,
regulating companies including Boeing <BA.N> and Musk's Tesla
<TSLA.O>.    
    The department's email to employees on Monday said they
should include about five bullet points of accomplishments but
exclude classified information. Some other agencies have told
employees not to respond to the demand from Musk, who is CEO of
Tesla and SpaceX. 
    ""If you can't come up with five things that you did you know
maybe you shouldn't be employed here so again this is an easy

Monday.
    Duffy said the FAA cut 352 probationary employees out of

    The Trump administration sent air traffic controllers buyout
offers but later said they were not eligible, also declaring
other safety officials ineligible. The FAA remains about 3,500
controllers short of targeted staffing levels.
    A persistent shortage of controllers has delayed flights
and, at many facilities, controllers are working mandatory
overtime and six-day weeks to cover shifts.
    Duffy has said he is working on a plan to boost air traffic
control staffing and improve technology, and is reconsidering
rules that allowed air traffic control supervisors to reduce
staffing at Washington's Reagan National Airport before a fatal
Army helicopter-plane collision that killed 67 people in
January.

       WASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration laid off 4% of its staff as part
of a government-wide trimming of probationary employees, a
spokesperson said Monday.
    The agency has pending investigations into Tesla <TSLA.O>,
which is headed by Elon Musk, the CEO of the automaker and
President Donald Trump's senior adviser leading efforts to
shrink the government. 
    NHTSA said under President Joe Biden the agency grew by 30%
and is still considerably larger after the job cuts earlier this
month. Its workforce was about 800 before the job cuts.
        ""We have retained positions critical to the mission of
saving lives, preventing injuries, and reducing economic costs
due to road traffic crashes,"" NHTSA said, adding it ""will
continue to enforce the law on all manufacturers of motor
vehicles and equipment.""
  
        Last week, President Donald Trump's 
    nominee to serve as the second highest ranking official at
USDOT
     vowed the government will take a fair and objective
approach to overseeing auto safety probes into Tesla.
  
        NHTSA in 
    October opened an investigation into 2.4 million
     Tesla vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD)
software after four reported collisions, including a fatal 2023
crash, among other open safety probes.
  
        In January, NHTSA 
    opened a separate probe into 2.6 million
     Tesla vehicles over reports of crashes involving a feature
that allows users to move their cars remotely.
  
        Tesla in December 2023 recalled more than two million
U.S. vehicles to install new safeguards in its Autopilot
advanced driver-assistance system. The agency is still
investigating whether that recall is adequate to address
concerns that drivers are not paying attention.
  
        Earlier this month, 
    Trump nominated Apple
     <AAPL.O> lawyer  Jonathan Morrison to head NHTSA. He served
as chief counsel of NHTSA during the first Trump administration.

       Feb 24 (Reuters) - Tesla <TSLA.O> is readying a software
update for customers in China to offer driving-assistance
capabilities similar to its full self-driving (FSD) features in
the U.S., Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing a person
familiar with the matter.
    The capabilities will be deployed to customers who have paid
 64,000 yuan ($8,831.73) for what Tesla calls FSD, the report
said.
    The self-driving update will allow Tesla owners to use
driver-assist features on city streets, the report said, adding
that it will be introduced on select models and gradually
expanded.
    Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for
comment.
    The full roll-out of Tesla's self-driving features has faced
roadblocks as regulators probe the electric-vehicle maker's
software over safety and security issues owing to multiple
accidents and crashes.
    Earlier this month, Chinese EV giant BYD <002594.SZ> began
to offer advanced autonomous driving features on most of its
models, putting more pressure on Tesla to deliver with its own
software. 
    Reuters had previously reported that Tesla was considering
licensing FSD to other automakers in China and could sell it as
monthly subscription to customers.
    The move can help the company weather slowing demand for its
electric vehicles in the U.S. as consumers cut back on big
purchases due to economic uncertainty.
    Tesla said last month its sales in China rose to a record
high of more than 657,000 cars in 2024 in a highly competitive
market when its annual global deliveries fell for the first
time. 
        Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long-touted the company's
self-driving capabilities and analysts say his close ties with
U.S. President Donald Trump could help accelerate regulatory
approvals.

expressed are her own.)
    By Katrina Hamlin
       HONG KONG, Feb 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - At least
Makoto Uchida knows his turnaround plan for Nissan Motor
<7201.T> is worth something. The beleaguered $11 billion
Japanese carmaker’s CEO now has KKR <KKR.N> mulling an
investment, Bloomberg reported on the same day he officially
broke off merger talks with Honda <7267.T>. Foxconn <2317.TW> is
interested, as still, is Honda – if Uchida leaves, according to
the Financial Times. And now some Japanese bigwigs may want
Tesla <TSLA.O> to buy a stake, the FT reported on Friday.
There’s a clear prize: a successful overhaul could almost triple
Nissan’s valuation, Breakingviews calculates. Trouble is, it’s a
daunting risk-reward trade.
    Nissan's automotive unit has been leaking red ink, with a
roughly $1 billion operating loss in the first nine months of
this financial year. Shareholders appear to ascribe it a
negative value: the company's lending division alone is probably
worth some $12 billion, based on the average of 80% of book
value Japanese financial companies trade at, per Fitch.
    Assume Uchida hits his goal of boosting the carmaking arm's
operating margin to 4% for its March 2027 financial year. Using
estimates gathered by Visible Alpha of $77 billion in annual
revenue from selling 3.1 million vehicles, that'd bring in $3
billion. Lop off interest payments and 25% tax, and net profit
would be $2 billion. Apply a multiple of just over 7 times
earnings, the average for a basket of Japanese peers, and the
manufacturing business would be worth $14 billion.
    Such an improvement ought to bolster the finance unit, too,
so value it at its estimated March 2027 book value of almost $16
billion, per Visible Alpha. The combined entity could then
command a price tag of around $30 billion.
    Getting there from here is a tall order. It would require
proving that annual car sales will stabilise at around 3
million, having fallen to 3.4 million last year from almost 6
million in 2018. Uchida would also have to ensure that drivers
will on average pay 8% more for their Nissan than they do now.
The company has also been leaning on incentives to encourage
purchases.
    And he needs his plans to close factories and slash
headcount to both succeed and not be undone by rising costs
elsewhere. That could be hard: recent history shows Nissan's
expenses are sticky, and the company has to boost investment in
hybrid and electric vehicles. 
    External forces could make those requirements even harder.
If implemented, U.S. President Donald Trump's import tariffs
would hurt Nissan in its largest market; in its second-largest,
China, it and other foreign brands are losing share to local
rivals like BYD <002594.SZ> <1211.HK>.
    The prospect of finding synergies may give some potential
suitors more stomach for these risks than others: Honda has its
own auto unit, while KKR owns parts-maker Marelli, which counts
Nissan as a major customer. Whoever gets involved, though,
Uchida's company is in for a white-knuckle ride.

2025-02-24 09:45:26,"Germany's Merz will push up debt with help of left, says AfD leader",urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250224:nL5N3PF0JF:3,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"BERLIN, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The leader of the far-right
Alternative for Germany (AfD), the second largest party in
parliament after Sunday's election, said Germany's likely next
chancellor would be held hostage by left-wing parties that would
seek to loosen tough fiscal rules.
    The AfD's Alice Weidel compared the country's finances to
those of a company, saying that the likely new government of
conservative leader Friedrich Merz would be forced by left-wing
parties into borrowing more.
    ""(He) won't be able to implement anything that he promised,""
she said of Merz, a fiscal conservative who has however
indicated that he is open to easing Germany's debt brake in
order to increase defence spending.
    ""He will compromise with the left to loosen the debt brake,
and that's the opposite of what the country needs... The state
should function like a company and when a company is
over-indebted you know what happens,"" she added.
    The constitutionally enshrined debt brake limits Germany's
structural budget deficit to just 0.35% of national output. Many
economists say the strict fiscal rule is hampering efforts to
revive Germany's flagging economy, the largest in Europe. 
    Merz's conservatives, the Social Democrats and Greens failed
to gain the two-thirds parliamentary majority needed to change
the rule. While including the Left Party would make up the
numbers, it opposes raising defence spending, which is expected
to be a major part of any fiscal boost.
    The AfD and the Left both oppose military aid to Ukraine.   
    The AfD's 20% score marked the first time since World War
Two that a far-right party has taken second place in a national
election.
    
    ELON MUSK CALLS
    Weidel said she had received a congratulatory phone call
from Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric vehicle maker
Tesla and adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump. Musk was an
outspoken supporter of the AfD ahead of Sunday's election,
infuriating Germany's mainstream parties.
    ""When I turned my phone on this morning there were calls
from the U.S., including one from Elon Musk, who wanted to
congratulate me personally,"" she said.
    The AfD's success means it is time for other parties, in
particular Merz's conservatives, to ditch the so-called ""fire
wall"", she said, referring to a consensus among the mainstream
parties to exclude the AfD from power.
    ""This blockade is undemocratic,"" Weidel said. ""You can't
simply exclude millions of voters... We have built a strategic
basis from which we can overtake the conservatives in coming
years, becoming the biggest political force.""

    By Aditi Shah
       NEW DELHI, Feb 21 (Reuters) - India's EV policy, which
offers import tax cuts for foreign automakers investing in the
country, will restrict them from using funds spent on charging
infrastructure for such relief, increasing their car
manufacturing, a government document shows.
    India last year announced a policy aimed at attracting Tesla
<TSLA.O> to manufacture EVs in the country and let such foreign
carmakers import cars at a 15% tariff, from around 100% now, but
only if they invest at least $500 million for a factory.
    But the policy will mandate that automakers can count only
5% of their total EV investment as coming from creation of
charging infrastructure, even if they spend much more on the
power network, according to government document detailing draft
rules which is not public but was seen by Reuters.
    The government's plan comes just as Tesla gets closer to
entering India with imported cars, having finalised two
locations for showrooms. The restriction could upset those
automakers who may want to invest a bigger chunk of their
planned India investments into creating charging networks, which
remain far and few in India.
    An industry source privy to discussions with the government
said the call is being taken as New Delhi wants companies to
prioritise manufacturing, and not just charging networks. 
    In India's nascent EV market, many buyers have shied away
from making purchases due to lack of fast chargers.
    ""Expenditure incurred on charging infrastructure would be
considered up to (a) maximum 5% of the committed investment,""
the 47-page draft document from January 2025 stated.
    The government is holding consultations with carmakers and
other stakeholders on the draft rules and will finalise them by
next month, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
    India's ministry of heavy industries, which is spearheading
the new policy, did not respond to an email seeking comment.
    Tesla in a job advert last week said it is also looking for
a ""charging developer"" who would ""develop and manage pipeline of
new charging"" sites, and select locations for deployment. 
    The EV giant's chief Elon Musk put on hold his manufacturing
investment plans for India last year, amid falling electric car
sales globally.  
    Tesla's immediate India plan is to import cars and sell them
in India. Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump however have
repeatedly said India's tariffs for cars are too high.
    The new draft rules said companies which commit to India
manufacturing will also need to meet a minimum turnover of $577
million by the end of the fourth year of operation, and $866
million by the fifth year, to be eligible for lower tariffs on
up to 8,000 electric cars per year. 
    If they fail to do so, they will need to pay a penalty of
between 1%-3% of the revenue shortfall.
    Other foreign automakers like Hyundai <005380.KS> <HYUN.NS>
and Toyota Motor <7203.T> have shown interest in making EVs in
India at their existing and new factories.

    By Thomas Escritt
       BERLIN, Feb 23 (Reuters) - For the first time since the
Second World War, a far-right party has come second in a German
national election, a result that will keep it outside government
but make it a fearsome opponent of the ruling parties.  
    The Alternative for Germany, which has morphed since it was
founded in 2013 from a party of libertarian economists to an
anti-immigration, pro-Russia group, is forecast to have won the
backing of one-in-five Germans.
    The AfD has little chance of joining the government as the
other parties maintain a ""fire wall"" to keep it out of office,
but leader Alice Weidel implied in her victory speech that it
was only a matter of time before that changed.
    ""Our hand remains outstretched to form a government,"" she
told supporters, adding that it would be tantamount to
""electoral fraud"" if the first-placed conservatives chose to
govern with left-wing parties rather than them.
    If that happened, she said, ""next time we'll come first.""
    Weidel, the leader of a nativist party that preaches
traditional family values while raising her children with a
Swiss-based woman of Sri Lankan background, said the AfD was now
""a mainstream party"".
    Once internationally isolated, it now has an ally in the
White House, where Donald Trump's adviser Elon Musk, the world's
richest person, regularly posts his support.
    ""It's the most amazing feeling. I've been here since its
founding and to see it on 20% is amazing. We'll be kept out of
coalition, but as you can see, the conservatives are taking all
of our positions,"" said Gilbert Kalb, an AfD member celebrating
at the party's headquarters. 
    If cheers were slightly muted, that was because, although
its vote share doubled since 2021, the result fell short of the
more optimistic expectations.
    Traditionally a pensioners' party, the AfD made inroads
among the young, many of whom have experienced years of sluggish
economic growth. Exit poll data indicated 22% of
25-to-34-year-olds voted for the party, compared to 10% of those
aged 70 and over.  
    Ahead of the result, young men in close-fitting suits milled
around at the headquarters, drinking beer and eating bratwurst.
    The AfD has undergone successive waves of radicalisation
since its founding and is today under surveillance by security
services as an anti-democratic threat to Germany's
constitutional order.
    Policies include drastically restricting migration,
disbanding the European Union and dropping support for Ukraine
in its war with Russia. 
    One leading figure is regional boss Bjoern Hoecke, twice
convicted for shouting slogans of Adolf Hitler's Nazis. Honorary
chairman Alexander Gauland has described the Nazis' genocide of
Europe's Jews as a lone stain that could not disfigure the
glorious sweep of German history.
    It became the largest party in Hoecke's home state of
Thuringia last year, and did sufficiently well elsewhere that
only improbable and tricky coalitions of centre-right and far
left could keep them out of office.
    Even outside government it reshaped debate away from the
""welcome culture"" under which former Chancellor Angela Merkel
let a million refugees settle in 2015, with all mainstream
parties now pledging to tighten immigration controls.
    
    STILL ISOLATED?
    Forecasts suggest it will have 23% of seats in parliament,
just under the number needed to set up parliamentary committees
of inquiry that can summon witnesses and set the news agenda.
    In a sign of quite how far outside Europe's mainstream it
is, other far right parties, including Marine Le Pen's National
Rally, have refused to work with a party that reminds many
Europeans of Germany's Nazi past.
    Some legislators nurture close ties with Russia and China:
one European Parliament member, Petr Bystron is under
investigation for taking payment from a Russian-backed
disinformation outlet. Another, Maximilian Krah, was suspended
after prosecutors said one of his assistants was spying for
China.
    There are still formidable barriers in its way: its
headquarters, next to an African restaurant on a side street in
a distant suburb, is far removed from the other parties'
imposing central offices because the stigma surrounding the
party is so great that no landlord agreed to let to them.
    But there are signs its political isolation is crumbling:
Weidel received an invitation to Budapest to see Viktor Orban,
who praised her as a ""brave woman"" after she lambasted a
journalist for describing her party as far-right.
    Other populists such as Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo
Salvini and Dutch anti-Islam nationalist Geert Wilders offered
congratulations on Sunday.
    A year ago, the party seemed to be at a low ebb, buffeted by
revelations by investigative journalists that several of its
most senior members had met at a secret conference outside
Berlin to discuss ""remigration"" - the deportation of non-ethnic
German holders of German citizenship.
    Nationwide protests followed, and the party briefly slipped
in polls, but with the economy in crisis and a population
disconcerted by war, it scored record results in four successive
regional elections in the autumn.
    The president of Germany's Central Jewish Council, Josef
Schuster, told Welt newspaper he was shocked at the strength of
the AfD's result.
    ""This should worry all of us, that a fifth of German voters
have voted for a party that in at least some of its policies is
far-right, and which in its language and ideology seeks clear
links with the radical right and neo-Nazism ...,"" he said.

       Feb 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's Trump Media & Technology Group <DJT.O>
said on Friday it will propose reincorporating the company in Florida at its annual meeting in
late April.  
    ""We look forward to uniting our legal home with our physical home as we explore
possibilities for mergers, acquisitions, partnerships, and other growth,"" said CEO Devin Nunes.
    Nunes added that the company is committed to Florida, which ""shows tremendous respect for
free enterprise.""
    The proposal comes as several companies, including Dropbox <DBX.O> and Bill Ackman's
management company, have recently said they were moving or considering moving their
incorporation out of Delaware. 
    The Wall Street Journal reported in late January that social media giant Meta Platforms
<META.O> is in discussions about moving its incorporation from Delaware to Texas or other
states.
    Elon Musk's Tesla <TSLA.O> and SpaceX moved their state of incorporation to Texas from
Delaware after a Chancery judge last year ordered Musk's $56 billion pay package from Tesla to
be rescinded.
    For Trump Media, a Delaware judge had ruled in September that the company breached an
agreement with Orlando's ARC Global and the fund must receive more than half a million
additional shares before a lock-up on insider sales expires.

       NEW YORK, Feb 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks tumbled on
Friday, extending their selloff in the wake of dour economic
reports and closing the book on a holiday-shortened week fraught
with new tariff threats and worries of softening consumer
demand.
    All three major U.S. stock indexes moved decisively lower on
the heels of the data, and continued their slide into afternoon
trading. 
        The S&P 500 suffered its largest single-day percentage
drop since December 18, as did the small cap Russell 2000.
  
        For the week, all three indexes lost ground, with the
Dow registering its steepest Friday-to-Friday plunge since
mid-October.
    ""I don't like all this red on a Friday,"" said Greg Bassuk,
CEO at AXS Investments in New York. ""We're seeing consumer
sentiment, tariffs and corporate earnings having leap-frogged AI
and technology as the primary drivers of market direction.""
    Economic data showed U.S. business activity decelerating and
consumer sentiment deteriorating, with survey participants
expressing an increasingly gloomy outlook in the face of
economic unknowns.
    The data comes on the heels of Walmart's <WMT.N>
disappointing guidance on Thursday, which sparked fears of
dampening consumer demand.
    U.S. businesses' optimism has ""evaporated,"" according to PMI
commentary provided by S&P Global's chief economist Chris
Williamson, amid ""a darkening picture of heightened
uncertainty.""  
    ""Uncertainty is the new investor narrative,"" Bassuk added.
""It's sparking the volatility that we've seen this week.""
    ""We're anticipating that the uncertainty and the volatility
is going to remain at least through the end of this first
quarter."" 
    Economically sensitive sectors, such as Dow Transports
<.DJT>, chips <.SOX>, smallcaps <.RUT>, housing <.HGX>, and
consumer discretionary <.SPLRCD> slid more than 2%. 
    Megacap momentum stocks <.NYFANG> dropped 2.9%, and every
stock in the ""Magnificent Seven"" ended in negative territory,
with Nvidia <NVDA.O>, due to report earnings next week, tumbling
4.1%.
        The CBOE volatility index <.VIX> closed at its highest
level since February 3.
    This week, U.S. President Donald Trump said he will soon
announce new tariffs covering lumber and forest products, in
addition to previously announced plans to impose duties on
imported cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 748.63 points,
or 1.69%, to 43,428.02, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 104.39 points,
or 1.71%, to 6,013.13 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> lost
438.36 points, or 2.20%, to 19,524.01.
    Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, all but consumer
staples <.SPLRCS> ended lower, with consumer discretionary and
tech <.SPLRCT> suffering the steepest percentage losses.
    Fourth-quarter earnings season is in its final stretch. Some
425 of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported, with 76% of
them beating Wall Street expectations, according to LSEG.
    Tesla <TSLA.O> and Rivian <RIVN.O> each dropped 4.7% after
both electric vehicle makers announced recalls.
    Analysts now see aggregate fourth-quarter S&P 500 earnings
growth of 15.7% year-on-year, a significant improvement over the
7.8% annual growth prediction as on January 1, per LSEG.
    Shares of UnitedHealth <UNH.N> tumbled 7.2% following a Wall
Street Journal report that the Department of Justice has
launched an investigation into the health insurer's Medicare
billing practices.
    Block <XYZ.N> tumbled 17.7% after the payment firm's
fourth-quarter profit fell short of estimates.
    Akamai Technologies <AKAM.O> dropped 21.7% as the

price)
    By David Shepardson and Aditya Soni
       WASHINGTON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Tesla <TSLA.O> on Friday
said it was recalling 376,000 of its electric vehicles in the
U.S., due to a failure of the power steering assist feature that
could make the vehicles harder to steer, particularly at low
speeds, raising the risk of a crash. 
        Tesla shares fell 3% in mid-day trading. 
  
    The recall follows a more than year-long probe by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after some Tesla
owners reported steering failures. Some were unable to turn the
wheel while others cited increased effort. More than 50 vehicles
were allegedly towed due to the issue, NHTSA said last year.
    Reuters reported in late 2023 that tens of thousands of
owners had experienced premature failures of suspension or
steering parts since 2016, citing Tesla documents and interviews
with customers and former employees.
    In a filing with NHTSA, Tesla said some 2023 Model 3 sedans
and Model Y crossovers running older software could face an
overvoltage breakdown, potentially overstressing motor drive
components on the printed circuit board.
    Tesla said that if this overstress condition occurs while
the vehicle is in motion, steering remains unaffected, and a
visual alert is triggered. But once the vehicle stops, the
steering assist may fail and remain disabled when it moves
again. 
    As of January 10, Tesla has identified 3,012 warranty claims
and 570 field reports that may be related to the condition but
said it had no reports of any crashes related to the condition.
    Tesla said the recall is not in response to NHTSA’s
investigation of allegations of loss of steering control, which
remains open.
        The company released an over-the-air software update in
October to address the issue but did not file the recall report
until this week. As of January 23, 99% of affected vehicles in
the U.S. have installed the update, Tesla said.
        On January 16, Tesla said it decided to issue a steering
recall around the world after a unnamed foreign regulator opened
an investigation and raised concerns about the issue.
  
        This recall marks the automaker's second large recall
this year. In
     January, Tesla recalled about 239,000 vehicles
     due to malfunctioning rear-view cameras.
  
    Tesla stock has declined around 10% this year, after a
strong 2024.

    By Aditi Shah
       NEW DELHI, Feb 21 (Reuters) - India's EV policy, which
offers import tax cuts for foreign automakers investing in the
country, will restrict them from using funds spent on charging
infrastructure for such relief, increasing their car
manufacturing, a government document shows.
    India last year announced a policy aimed at attracting Tesla
<TSLA.O> to manufacture EVs in the country and let such foreign
carmakers import cars at a 15% tariff, from around 100% now, but
only if they invest at least $500 million for a factory.
    But the policy will mandate that automakers can count only
5% of their total EV investment as coming from creation of
charging infrastructure, even if they spend much more on the
power network, according to government document detailing draft
rules which is not public but was seen by Reuters.
    The government's plan comes just as Tesla gets closer to
entering India with imported cars, having finalised two
locations for showrooms. The restriction could upset those
automakers who may want to invest a bigger chunk of their
planned India investments into creating charging networks, which
remain far and few in India.
    An industry source privy to discussions with the government
said the call is being taken as New Delhi wants companies to
prioritise manufacturing, and not just charging networks. 
    In India's nascent EV market, many buyers have shied away
from making purchases due to lack of fast chargers.
    ""Expenditure incurred on charging infrastructure would be
considered up to (a) maximum 5% of the committed investment,""
the 47-page draft document from January 2025 stated.
    The government is holding consultations with carmakers and
other stakeholders on the draft rules and will finalise them by
next month, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
    India's ministry of heavy industries, which is spearheading
the new policy, did not respond to an email seeking comment.
    Tesla in a job advert last week said it is also looking for
a ""charging developer"" who would ""develop and manage pipeline of
new charging"" sites, and select locations for deployment. 
    The EV giant's chief Elon Musk put on hold his manufacturing
investment plans for India last year, amid falling electric car
sales globally.  
    Tesla's immediate India plan is to import cars and sell them
in India. Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump however have
repeatedly said India's tariffs for cars are too high.
    The new draft rules said companies which commit to India
manufacturing will also need to meet a minimum turnover of $577
million by the end of the fourth year of operation, and $866
million by the fifth year, to be eligible for lower tariffs on
up to 8,000 electric cars per year. 
    If they fail to do so, they will need to pay a penalty of
between 1%-3% of the revenue shortfall.
    Other foreign automakers like Hyundai <005380.KS> <HYUN.NS>
and Toyota Motor <7203.T> have shown interest in making EVs in
India at their existing and new factories.

    By Nora Eckert
       DETROIT, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Some middle managers at Ford
Motor <F.N> will not get stock bonuses this year in what is seen
internally as CEO Jim Farley's latest attempt to cut the
automaker's bloated costs, according to six people familiar with
the matter.
    Around 1,650 middle managers out of 3,300 globally will not
get stock bonuses, according to a person familiar with the
discussions.
    The stock awards are usually paid in March, but senior
managers have been told to select which half of their middle
management staff will receive them, four of the sources said. 
    Ford said the change was meant to incentivize an improvement
in employee performance. 
    ""We are focused on driving a high-performance culture that
recognizes and rewards employees for their business
contributions,"" a Ford spokesperson said.
The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker has struggled with inefficient
operations, within both its cash-burning electric vehicle
division and its fuel-powered vehicle business. 
    Farley has for years told employees and Wall Street that
Ford is undergoing a fundamental transformation to become leaner
and more competitive, as it races against U.S. rivals as well as
Chinese automakers and EV producer Tesla <TSLA.O>. 
Ford's stock slipped about 23% over the past year, while Detroit
rival General Motors' <GM.N> shares rose around 23% on the
strength of lower costs and higher profits.
The automaker and its competitors are also navigating the
uncertainty of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies,
which Farley said have added ""a lot of cost and a lot of chaos.""
Ford's rivals are more exposed to tariffs on Mexico and Canada,
which are scheduled to begin March 4, but the company could
still be hit by 25% duties on vehicles shipped from Mexico,
including its Mustang Mach-E, Bronco Sport, and Maverick pickup.
     
     
    'THE BEST TALENT'
    Employees were informed of the stock award changes in a
company briefing last week and told the rationale for slashing
bonuses was performance-based, the six sources said. 
    Some Ford workers viewed the move as a way for the automaker
to slim its ranks, and said they were looking for job openings
at other companies.
    ""With continued profit underperformance versus GM, Farley
probably does not want to say the status quo of continued stock
awards for all managers is acceptable,"" David Whiston, analyst
for Morningstar, said in an email.
    ""This could be a way to get some people to quit given the
focus is on middle managers,"" Whiston added.
    Stock grant bonuses have typically been regarded as a way to
retain talent at the automaker, which Farley recently said was
key to its competitiveness. The awards vest over three years.
""The most important for me is the best talent and the best
culture,"" Farley told analysts on an earnings call this month,
saying the company could not improve its results without
recruiting and keeping the right people. 
    The stock awards are part of a larger performance-based
compensation system, which also includes cash awards. The
bonuses are granted to salaried employees companywide, most of
them managers. 
Separately, Ford sets a companywide bonus based on metrics
including vehicle quality, total earnings and EV sales, which
amounted to 69% in 2024 of the total potential bonus, three of
the sources said. Reuters reported in October that those bonuses
would be cut based on lackluster company performance.

 (Adds background on Tesla capacity, deliveries in paragraphs
5-6, analyst comment about US tariffs in paragraphs 15-16,
detail about Tesla cash in paragraph 17)
       Feb 21 (Reuters) - A high-level Japanese group that
includes a former prime minister has drawn up plans for Tesla
<TSLA.O> to invest in Nissan <7201.T> after the collapse of its
merger talks with Honda <7267.T>, the Financial Times said on
Friday.
    A separate Nikkei newspaper report said Taiwan's Foxconn
<2317.TW> has proposed forming a partnership with Honda with an
ultimate aim of creating a four-way framework that would also
include Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors <7211.T>.
    The Japanese group behind the plans for Tesla to invest in
Nissan hopes the Elon Musk-led company will become a strategic
investor, believing it is keen to acquire Nissan's plants in the
United States, according to the Financial Times.
    The proposal is being led by former Tesla board member
Hiromichi Mizuno with support from ex-premier Yoshihide Suga and
his former aide Hiroto Izumi, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified sources.
    Some analysts, however, are doubtful of Tesla's interest in
acquiring U.S. plants, citing its ample capacity at existing
factories and first decline in yearly deliveries in 2024.
        Tesla said last month it expected the vehicle business
to 
    return to growth
     this year.
  
    Suga's office said it was not aware of a plan to encourage
Tesla to invest in Nissan. Suga stood down as prime minister in
2021 but remains a member of Japan's lower house, representing a
constituency in Nissan's home prefecture of Kanagawa.
    In a social media post, Mizuno said he had ""absolutely no
involvement"" in what was reported in the FT article, adding that
he doubted if Tesla had any interest at all in Nissan factories
given Tesla's unique factory design.
    Nissan declined to comment on the report, while Tesla did
not respond to requests for comment. Reuters was not immediately
able to contact Izumi.
        Matt Britzman, a senior equity analyst at Hargreaves
Lansdown, said there was no value for Tesla in investing in
infrastructure from a legacy carmaker.
    ""Tesla's secret weapon is the novel way its factories have
been designed and optimised for its cars,"" Britzman said.
    Nissan shares closed up 9.6% after the FT report. The
automaker and Honda ended talks to forge a $60-billion car
company last week. Nissan said it will seek new partnerships. 
    According to the FT, some Nissan board members have
suggested Tesla and Apple <AAPL.O> as ideal strategic investors.
    Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
    Acquiring Nissan's U.S. plants might make sense considering
President Donald Trump's plans to apply new tariffs on auto
imports, and separate tariffs on Mexico and Canada, said
Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein.
        ""The cost to build a new auto plant is high, so if Tesla
is able to acquire an existing plant that greatly reduces the
cost,"" he said.
  
    Tesla ended 2024 with $36.56 billion in cash and
equivalents, giving it a large war chest for any deal, although
it has shown little appetite for investing in auto companies.
    Sources have previously told Reuters that Nissan was open to
working with new partners, with the world's largest contract
electronics manufacturer Foxconn seen as one candidate.
    Later on Friday, the Nikkei newspaper reported that through
partnering with Honda, Foxconn aimed to form a broader framework
for cooperation to compete against Tesla and Chinese EV makers.
    Honda declined to comment on the Nikkei report. Foxconn
representatives did not immediately reply to a comment request.
    Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida said last week that Nissan and
Foxconn had not held talks at management level. A day before
Uchida made his remarks, the Taiwanese firm's chairman had said
it would consider taking a stake in Nissan for cooperation.

       MILAN, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Italy's competition authority
said on Friday it was investigating BYD <002594.SZ>, Stellantis
<STLAMI.MI>, Tesla <TSLA.O> and Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE> for
allegedly misleading consumers on the performance of their
electric vehicles.
    The investigations for possible unfair commercial practices
concern information ""on EV driving range, battery capacity
degradation and limitations on standard battery warranties,
potentially in breach of the Consumer Code"", the watchdog said
in a statement. 
    Under Italian legislation, breaches of consumer rights rules
can lead to company fines ranging from 5,000 euros ($5,230) to
10 million euros.
    Stellantis said in a statement it was fully cooperating with
the authority and had provided the necessary answers,
information and documentation.
    ""Stellantis... is convinced that it has provided adequate,
precise and exhaustive answers to the questions posed by the
officials,"" it said. 
    ""Stellantis places the needs and satisfaction of its
customers at the centre of all its activities and believes that
the ongoing investigation will confirm this"".
    BYD and Volkswagen declined to comment on the
investigations. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request
for comment.
    According to the authority, the automakers' websites offer
""generic and sometimes contradictory information"" on electric
car driving ranges, without clarifying which factors may impact
the advertised maximum range, and to what extent. 
    The range of EVs may be significantly reduced by external
conditions such as cold weather or the use of air conditioning
in hot temperatures, as well as the type of routes traveled.
    The regulator also alleged that websites failed to give
consumers clear and complete information on battery capacity
degradation resulting from normal vehicle use, and on the terms
or limitations of the battery warranty.
    As is customary in such cases, the authority said it carried
out inspections on Thursday at the Italian headquarters of the
four automakers, aided by the Guardia di Finanza, Italy's
financial crimes police.

2025-02-21 06:00:00,Electric transport groups urge EU not to ease CO2 emission rules,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250221:nL2N3PA0CV:2,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"By Alessandro Parodi and Philip Blenkinsop
       Feb 21 (Reuters) - The European Union should reject
European automakers' push to weaken 2025 CO2 car emission
targets and related fines, two European electric transport
groups wrote in a letter to European Commission President Ursula
von der Leyen on Friday.
    The letter, seen by Reuters, said the EU executive, which
will present auto sector plans on March 5, should not accept
slower phasing in of emission targets or basing fines on a
multi-year average and that any fines should go to subsidise the
bloc's transition to electric vehicles (EVs).
    EU carmakers, which are struggling to compete with Chinese
rivals and bracing for U.S. tariffs, are urging the Commission
to grant relief from fines they say could rise to 15 billion
euros ($15.7 billion) if their fleets do not meet CO2 emission
limits in 2025.
    Any flexibility that pushes back the 2025 CO2 limits will
only put Europe further behind China in EVs and have a chilling
effect on EU investment plans in charging infrastructure,
battery development and manufacturing, the letter from
E-Mobility Europe and ChargeUp Europe said.
    E-Mobility Europe represents EV makers, supply chain
companies, fleet owners and infrastructure providers, while
ChargeUp Europe focuses on the EV charging industry. Tesla
<TSLA.O> is a member of both.
    EU automakers say the problem they face is a shortage of
demand, due in part to consumer concerns about inadequate
charging infrastructure.
    Aurelien de Meaux, chief executive of charging company
Electra, said this was a false narrative and that EU charging
stations could accept five to seven times more vehicles without
being saturated and that his sector was investing billions of
euros in infrastructure expansion.
    ""It would be a disaster to backpedal on policy,"" he said.
    The groups said in the letter that the 2025 CO2 targets are
achievable, pointing to 11 new models priced under 25,000 being
launched and January 2025 EV sales up 40% year-on-year.
    De Meaux also said the 15 billion euro fine figure was based
on sales in the first six months of 2024 and so wrong. He said
projections pointed to fines of perhaps 4-6 billion euros, which
could be halved through trading credits with other companies.
    The groups support targets or incentives for corporate
fleets to electrify, given they make up about 60% of new car
sales.

Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland.
    The red metallic chainsaw, given to Musk by Milei earlier in

coarse Spanish slogan: ""Viva la libertad, carajo,"" which loosely

    By Akash Sriram
       Feb 20 (Reuters) - Rivian <RIVN.O> projected a surprise
drop in electric vehicle deliveries for the year but said it
expected to post a modest gross profit, as it slashed raw
material and supply chain costs in its drive for efficiency.
    Rivian and other EV makers are facing tough demand as buyers
opt for cheaper gas-powered cars in an uncertain economic and
political climate. The Trump administration's new policies and
potential tariffs threaten to boost inflation just as it was
dipping, and EV buyers may no longer get tax credits that was a
key support for demand.
    Rivian shares rose as much as 7% in extended trading before
paring gains to trade up about 1%.
    The company also expects higher costs from U.S. President
Donald Trump's plans to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada. 
    ""We have a supply chain that does have a footprint in both
Mexico and Canada, and so large tariffs being applied will just
translate to higher costs for us,"" CEO RJ Scaringe told Reuters.
    ""There is such a high level of uncertainty that will
ultimately impact consumer behavior and top-line revenue,"" he
added.
    Rivian, however, posted a first-ever gross profit of $170
million in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $606
million a year earlier.
    Annual deliveries are expected to be between 46,000 and
51,000 vehicles, lower than Wall Street expectations of 55,520,
according to 15 analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Last year, it
delivered 51,579 units.
    ""I think they're appropriately being just cautious because
it's unclear and they have no control over what's going to
happen politically here,"" said Vitaly Golomb, managing partner
at Mavka Capital, a Rivian investor.
    The EV maker is also planning a month-long halt in
production in the second half of 2025, as it gears up to launch
the Tesla Model Y-rivaling R2 vehicle and start its deliveries
early next year.
    EV makers are staring at a tough market, with Elon Musk-led
market leader Tesla <TSLA.O> reporting its first drop in annual
sales in 2024.
    Electric big rig manufacturer Nikola <NKLA.O> recently filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after struggling with rapid
cash burn and funding challenges amid weak demand. 
    Revenue for the last three months of the year stood at $1.73
billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $1.4 billion,
according to LSEG data.
    Its software and services segment generated $214 million in
fourth-quarter revenue, doubling from a year earlier.
    Rivian said that over the next four years, it expects to
recognize about $2 billion in revenue from its joint venture
with Germany's Volkswagen Group <VOWG_p.DE>.
    The EV maker and Volkswagen formalized a joint venture to
develop software and electrical architecture last year. As part
of the deal, the German automaker would invest $5.8 billion in
Rivian.

Shepardson
       Feb 20 (Reuters) - Boeing <BA.N> CEO Kelly Ortberg on
Thursday said Elon Musk, the head of its space business rival
SpaceX, is ""helping us a lot"" in navigating through delays in
delivering Boeing's Air Force One presidential jet.
    Ortberg also told an investor conference that he expects top
U.S. aviation regulators to visit Seattle soon, where the
planemaker's strongest-selling 737 MAX jet is produced. 
    Ortberg, who took the helm of Boeing six months ago, is
trying to grow production of the embattled planemaker's MAX and
787 jets to at least 38 a month, while sorting contracts that
hit its defense unit with pre-tax charges of $1.7 billion in the
fourth quarter.
    Ortberg told the Barclays Industrial Select Conference that
Boeing is making progress with the help of Trump's cost-cutting
ally Musk in improving the delivery time, which will eliminate
the risk of continued cost overruns. 
    ""Elon Musk is actually helping us a lot in working through
the requirements...so that we can move faster and get the
president those airplanes delivered,"" Ortberg said.
    ""And you know he's a brilliant guy so he's able to pretty
quickly ascertain the difference between technical requirements
and things that we can move out of the way and he's helping us
in a big way."" 
    Earlier this week, a senior administration official said the
 Air Force One program may be further delayed until 2029 or
years later due partly to supply chain problems. Trump has said
he is not happy with Boeing due to delays in delivering Air
Force One planes, adding his administration might have to ""do
something else.""
    Separately, Boeing said on Thursday it had named Jeff
Shockey executive vice president of government operations. He
will lead the planemaker's global public policy efforts,
including federal operations among other things. 
    Problems in the aerospace supply chain have hampered the
recovery of the embattled planemaker which has lurched from
crisis to crisis, and also weighed on production plans by
European rival Airbus <AIR.PA>. 
    U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Federal
Aviation Administration Acting Administrator Chris Rocheleau are
expected to visit Seattle sometime in March, a source familiar
with the matter said. 
    While Ortberg said the 737 supply chain was in good shape,
he acknowledged the planemaker is assessing the impact of a fire
this week at a Pennsylvania factory and key Boeing supplier that
makes fasteners for aircraft. Boeing shares dipped 2% in late
morning trade.
    An industry source said the fire at SPS Technologies, part
of Berkshire Hathaway-owned Precision Castparts, is significant
for Boeing as it is an important producer of fasteners for the
787. Dreamliner production is set to grow from five a month to
seven a month this year. 
    ""We do have a lot of components that come out of that
factory,"" Ortberg said. ""I just heard, for example, that a big
shipment that they had to ship to us - the parts are done and
they are okay and they are in their warehouse but we can't get
them out right now.""

       WASHINGTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's
nominee to serve as the second highest ranking official at the
U.S. Transportation Department vowed the government will take a
fair and objective approach to overseeing auto safety probes
into Tesla <TSLA.O>.
    Asked if he would commit to ensuring auto safety regulators
hold Tesla accountable, nominee Steve Bradbury said yes.
    The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in
October opened an investigation into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles
equipped with Full Self-Driving (FSD) software after four
reported collisions, including a fatal 2023 crash, among other
open safety probes.
    U.S. Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan, cited
the FSD investigation and noted that the technology does not
make vehicles self-driving and that human drivers must remain
attentive.
    ""There's a history of Tesla misleading consumers regarding
what that technology is actually capable of doing and
unfortunately that has led to deaths as a result of it,"" Peters
said at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing.
    Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    Peters noted that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a close adviser to
Trump, and has previously criticized NHTSA's regulatory efforts.
Musk is currently overseeing the Trump administration push to
significantly shrink the federal government.
    Last month, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said a key
Tesla safety probe would continue.
    In January, NHTSA opened a separate probe into 2.6 million
Tesla vehicles over reports of crashes involving a feature that
allows users to move their cars remotely.
    Tesla in December 2023 recalled more than two million U.S.
vehicles to install new safeguards in its Autopilot advanced
driver-assistance system. The agency is still investigating 
whether that recall is adequate to address concerns that drivers
are not paying attention.
    Last week, Trump nominated an Apple <AAPL.O> lawyer to head
NHTSA. Jonathan Morrison, who served as chief counsel of NHTSA 
during the first Trump administration, had previously worked for
the California New Car Dealers
    The scrutiny of the advanced driver-assistance system comes
as Musk looks to pivot toward self-driving technology and
robotaxis.

    By Nathan Layne
       Feb 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is
expected to fire about 6,700 employees on Thursday, a person
familiar with the matter said, eliminating roughly 7% of the
tax-collecting agency's workforce in the midst of the critical
tax-filing season.
    The planned cuts are part of President Donald Trump's
radical downsizing effort that has targeted bank regulators,
forest workers, rocket scientists and tens of thousands of other
government employees. The effort is being led by tech
billionaire Elon Musk, Trump's biggest campaign donor. 
    The planned layoffs at the IRS would largely target workers
at the 95,000-person agency who were hired as part of an
expansion under former Democratic President Joe Biden, who had
sought to expand enforcement efforts on wealthy taxpayers.
    Trump's Republicans have blasted that effort, saying without
evidence that middle-class Americans and small business owners
would be the ones hardest hit. 
    The workers being cut are in their probationary period and
enjoy fewer protections than career employees.
    The IRS, which has not confirmed the planned cuts, has taken
a more careful approach to downsizing than other agencies given
that it is in the middle of its busiest period, with the April
15 tax filing deadline just two months away.
    The 2025 tax filing season opened on January 27, with the
IRS expecting over 140 million individual tax year 2024 returns
by the federal filing deadline. 
    The dismissals targeted employees involved in a variety of
roles, ranging from revenue agents to specialized auditors to IT
specialists across all 50 states, Puerto Rico and Washington,
D.C., according to the person familiar with the matter.
    The IRS will retain several thousand probationary employees
deemed critical for processing tax returns, including those
involved in supporting and advocating for taxpayers, the source
said.
    The White House has not said how many of the nation's 2.3
million civil-service workers it wants to fire and has given no
numbers on the mass layoffs. Roughly 75,000 took a buyout offer
last week.
    The campaign has delighted Republicans for culling a federal
workforce they view as bloated, corrupt and insufficiently loyal
to Trump, while also taking aim at government agencies that
regulate big business and collect taxes -- including those that
oversee Musk's companies SpaceX, Tesla <TSLA.O> and Neuralink.
    Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team has also
cancelled contracts worth about $8.5 billion involving foreign
aid, diversity training and other initiatives opposed by Trump.
    Both men have set a goal of cutting at least $1 trillion
from the $6.7 trillion federal budget, though Trump has said he
will not touch popular benefit programs that make up roughly
one-third of that total.
    Democratic critics say Trump is exceeding his constitutional
authority and hacking away at popular and critical government
programs at the expense of legions of middle-class families.

    By Peter Eisler, Rachael Levy, Marisa Taylor
       WASHINGTON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Federal regulators have
cited Tesla <TSLA.O> for violating workplace safety rules in
connection with the electrocution of a worker last summer at its
Austin, Texas, auto-manufacturing plant.
    The U.S. Department of Labor confirmed the findings in a
statement to Reuters.
    “The investigation is closed and citations have been
issued,” said the department, which oversees the agency that
conducted the Tesla probe, the U.S. Occupational Safety and
Health Administration.
    The Labor Department said the matter was concluded in late
January. The department declined to disclose the nature of
Tesla's workplace-safety failures or whether any penalties were
imposed.
    The case has been closely watched amid public debate about
the oversight of Tesla and other businesses run by billionaire
Elon Musk as he directs a radical overhaul of federal agencies
on behalf of U.S. President Donald Trump.
    Musk, who spent more than $250 million to help elect Trump,
now steers the newly created Department of Government
Efficiency, which aims to slash federal spending and staffing.
Musk's businesses, including Tesla and rocket-maker SpaceX, rely
heavily on government contracts, subsidies and policies.
    OSHA launched the investigation immediately after the August
1 death of Victor Gomez Sr., an electrician working as a
contractor at the Tesla plant in Texas, according to OSHA
records and a wrongful death lawsuit filed against Tesla by
Gomez's family.
    Gomez was killed while inspecting electrical panels at the
site, according to the suit. The lawsuit alleges negligence and
argues that the panel was supposed to be inactive but had
already been powered up, resulting in Gomez’s electrocution.
    Musk and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Reuters could not immediately access court filings by Tesla in
the lawsuit.
    On Wednesday, U.S. Representative Greg Casar, a Texas
Democrat whose congressional district includes the Tesla plant,
sent a letter to the Labor Department urging that OSHA
immediately release the full results of its investigation of
Gomez’s death. The letter said that a refusal to release public
records on Tesla's workplace safety failures could raise
questions about whether the agency is giving Musk preferential
treatment.
    ""Americans have a right to know whether Tesla and its
contractors put a man’s life at risk, and whether Tesla will
follow workplace safety rules going forward,"" the letter read.
    The plant, a 10-million square-foot facility in Austin,
Texas, is a manufacturing hub for Tesla’s Model Y vehicles and
Cybertrucks.
    OSHA records show Tesla was cited and fined about $7,000 for
two other workplace safety violations at the Texas plant last
year, both involving violations of rules to protect workers from
chemical hazards. In 2022, the company also was hit with a pair
of complaints claiming that it failed to address alleged
workplace-safety and wage-law violations by subcontractors
during the construction of the facility.

       MUMBAI, Feb 20 (Reuters Breakingviews) - India may get
more than it bargained for when it comes to Elon Musk. The Tesla
<TSLA.O> boss' role in the White House might make it easier for
him to set the terms of his entry into the world's third-largest
car market. But President Donald Trump's aim of cutting the U.S.
trade deficit will leave India less leverage to wrangle coveted
factory jobs it wants from Musk.
    The electric vehicle maker has identified locations for two
stores in India, Reuters reported citing unnamed sources, and is
hiring for customer-facing and back-end roles in the country.
That has fuelled speculation that Musk's meeting with Indian
Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week may pave the road for
Tesla to finally sell cars in the country.
    The biggest deterrence is India's high tariffs on imported
vehicles, which New Delhi once hoped would persuade foreign
brands to manufacture locally. But the Tesla boss has resisted,
probably because local demand for luxury EVs has yet to catch up
to China, the company's second most important country by revenue
after the United States. 
    It's possible that Modi may now consider lowering or
dropping the auto tariffs - to please Trump - or carving out
exemptions for Tesla. But that would only weaken New Delhi's
hand in negotiating with Musk.
    Trump has already remarked that a Tesla factory in India
aimed at circumventing local duties would be ""unfair"" to the
U.S. Moreover, it's not clear Tesla needs another factory
either. The EV maker utilised just three-quarters of its
existing production capacity across the U.S., Germany and China
in 2024 - down slightly from the year before. That suggests the
company expects global demand to slow further. 
    The risk to Modi is for him to grant concessions to Musk,
only to end up with little more than Tesla showrooms. True, the
government has another bargaining chip: Musk's Starlink is
awaiting security clearance for a licence to offer satellite
broadband services in India. But against the backdrop of Trump's
tariff threats, New Delhi should be careful of what it wishes
for from the world's richest man.

 (Recasts with India sales target, EV plans, analyst comment)
    By Daniel Leussink and Aditi Shah
       TOKYO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Japanese carmaker Suzuki Motor
has trimmed its sales target in India, its ""most important
market"", and scaled back its line-up of electric car launches,
even as it plans to expand global sales by a third to 4.2
million vehicles by fiscal year 2030.
    Suzuki <7269.T> expects to sell about 2.5 million cars in
India by March 2031, down from an October 2023 target of 3
million, and will launch just four EVs in the country instead of
six planned, the company said on Thursday.
    The sales cut in India, Suzuki's biggest market by revenue
and volumes, comes as local unit Maruti Suzuki <MRTI.NS> has
been losing ground to new, feature-rich cars and SUVs from
rivals Tata Motors <TAMO.NS> and Mahindra & Mahindra <MAHM.NS>.
    The scaleback on EV launches coincides with a slowdown in
their sales globally and Tesla's <TSLA.O> impending entry in
India, the world's third-largest car market, where it has
finalised locations for its first showroom. 
    Maruti's share of India's passenger vehicles market is down
to 41% from a recent peak of about 51% by March 2020. It had set
a market share target of 50% by March 2026 which it now expects
to achieve by March 2031. 
    ""The competitive environment is becoming increasingly
severe, and the quality of product functions, equipment and
services required by customers is increasing,"" Suzuki said in a
presentation laying out its five-year strategy to March 2031. 
    A shift in buyer preferences in India has brought a steep
decline in the sales of small cars, a mainstay for Suzuki, and a
rise in the popularity of mid-sized SUVs which the Japanese
company has been late in introducing. 
    Suzuki now plans to beef up its line-up of SUVs in India and
expand manufacturing capacity there to 4 million units a year
""at appropriate time"" from about 2 million. The company had
earlier planned to scale up to 4 million units by March 2031.
    India is still at the forefront of Suzuki's expansion and
will receive 60% of a planned investment of 2 trillion yen ($13
billion) by that date, and will be its production hub for global
exports to the Middle East and Africa, including for EVs. 
    ""India is Suzuki's most important market where we are
putting the most effort,"" President Toshihiro Suzuki told a
strategy briefing in Tokyo on Thursday.
    ""The sales situation of BEVs is not favourable, particularly
in Europe. This shows that new technologies cannot grow without
customer acceptance,"" he said, adding that Suzuki was working on
a mix of technologies including hybrids and bio gas.
    Suzuki also said it would target an overall operating profit
margin of at least 10% by 2030, up from 9.2% in the past
financial year, and aims for revenue of 8 trillion yen by the
2030 financial year, a jump of 49%.
    Gaurav Vangaal, an S&P Global analyst in India, said the
mid-year plan reflected a strategic recalibration in response to
competition and a slowing global approach towards EV transition.

    By David Shepardson
       WASHINGTON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency said on Wednesday it has submitted the Biden
administration's approval of California's landmark plan to end
the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035 to Congress for
review and potential repeal.
    The decision by the new Trump administration gives the
Republican-led Congress a chance to repeal the Biden decision to
grant California a waiver under the Clean Air Act for its
program under the Congressional Review Act.
    As a candidate, President Donald Trump vowed to rescind
approvals granted by the EPA to California to require more EVs
and tighter vehicle emissions standards. Those rules have been
adopted by another 11 states, including New York, Massachusetts
and Oregon.
    EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who was nominated by Trump,
said the ""American people are struggling to make ends meet while
dealing with rules that take away their ability to choose a safe
and affordable vehicle for their families.""
            California's rules require 35% of vehicles in the
2026 model year to be a zero-emission model- a figure automakers
say is impossible to meet given current sales - rising to 68% by
2030. The state says the rule is crucial to meeting greenhouse
gas emission reduction targets and cutting smog-forming
pollutants.
  
        The EPA under former President Joe Biden took the
position that the waiver was not a regulation and therefore not
reviewable by Congress. It remains an open question if Congress
will be able to legally vote on the issue.
  
    California first announced a plan in 2020 to require that by
2035 at least 80% of new cars sold be electric and up to 20%
plug-in hybrid models.
    The EPA also granted in December a waiver for California's
“Omnibus” low-NOx regulation for heavy-duty highway and off-road
vehicles and engines.
    The EPA in March 2022 reinstated a waiver for California to
set its own tailpipe emissions limits and zero-emission vehicle
rules through 2025, reversing a 2019 decision under Trump's
first administration.
    The Trump EPA on Wednesday submitted the Omnibus waiver and
2022 waiver to Congress for possible repeal.
        The U.S. Transportation Department is separately moving
to undo aggressive fuel economy rules adopted by Biden.
  
    The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing General
Motors <GM.N>, Volkswagen <VOWG_p.DE>, Toyota Motor <7203.T> and
other automakers argue California's vehicle rules ""will depress
economic activity, increase costs and limit vehicle choice"" and
will require automakers to sell fewer vehicles in the 12 states
to comply.

2025-02-19 15:58:57,Trump says unfair to US if Musk builds factory in India,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250219:nL3N3PA0V5:1,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"NEW DELHI, Feb 19 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald
Trump has said that if Tesla <TSLA.O> were to build a factory in
India to circumvent that country's tariffs, it would be ""unfair""
to the U.S., in an interview with Fox News which aired on
Tuesday.
    Trump called out India's high duty on cars during Prime
Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the U.S. last week, but agreed
to work towards an early trade deal and resolve their standoff
over tariffs. 
    Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has long criticised India for having
import tariffs of around 100% on EVs which protect local
automakers such as Tata Motors in the world's third largest auto
market, where EV adoption is still at a nascent stage.
    Trump said it is ""impossible"" for Musk to sell a car in the
South Asian nation.
    ""Every country in the world takes advantage of us, and they
do it with tariffs... It is impossible to sell a car,
practically, in, as an example, India,"" he said.
    India's government in March unveiled a new EV policy
lowering import taxes substantially to 15% if a carmaker invests
at least $500 million and sets up a factory.    
    Reuters reported on Tuesday that Tesla has selected
locations for two showrooms in the Indian cities of New Delhi
and Mumbai, and posted job ads for 13 mid-level roles in India.
It does not currently manufacture any vehicles in India.
    Trump said it would be ""unfair"" to the U.S. if Musk did
decide to build a factory there. 
    ""Now, if he built the factory in India, that's okay, but
that's unfair to us. It's very unfair,"" Trump said in the
interview. 
    India's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a
request for comment.
    Trump's plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country that
taxes U.S. imports have raised the risk of a global trade war
with American friends and foes.

    By Akash Sriram
       Feb 19 (Reuters) - Nikola <NKLA.O> said on Wednesday it
had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and would pursue
a sale of its assets, the latest electric-vehicle maker to
stumble after grappling with tepid demand, rapid cash burn and
funding challenges.
    The development ends a challenging journey, which included
several leadership changes, plummeting share values and
short-seller allegations.
    EV startups that went public during the pandemic, promising
to revolutionize the sector, such as Fisker, Proterra and
Lordstown Motors have filed for bankruptcy in recent years as
funding for their capital-intensive operations dried up due to
high interest rates and flagging demand.
    ""Like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we
have faced various market and macroeconomic factors that have
impacted our ability to operate,"" Nikola CEO Steve Girsky said
in a statement.
    ""Unfortunately, our very best efforts have not been enough
to overcome these significant challenges,"" he added.
    Elon Musk-led EV pioneer Tesla <TSLA.O> reported its first
drop in annual sales in 2024 as high borrowing costs and an
aging lineup crimped demand, despite offers and incentives.    
    Nikola, which started out making battery-powered semi-trucks
and pivoted to electric trucks that use hydrogen, said it
decided to initiate a sale process to maximize value and ensure
an orderly wind down.
    The firm will continue some support operations for trucks in
the field and some hydrogen-fueling operations through the end
of March.
    Phoenix, Arizona-based Nikola, delivered its first vehicle
in December 2021. A series of fire incidents involving its
electric trucks in 2023 resulted in a recall of all its vehicles
and raised safety concerns.
    Nikola ramped up production of its hydrogen-powered trucks
in 2024, but still lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on
every vehicle sold as fleet operators were reluctant to invest
in electric truck adoption amid high borrowing costs.
    The stock fell about 38% on Wednesday, valuing the company
at less than $50 million. A sharp plunge from a peak market
capitalization of about $27 billion in 2020, when it was valued
more than Ford Motor <F.N>.
    ""Just the struggles that they have faced, plus the
increasing competition, operational challenges, and high cost
for the EV industry as a whole. I think all of that came
together,"" said Sarah Foss, head of legal at credit and
restructuring analysis firm Debtwire.
    
    STRUGGLING FINANCES
    The company, which has said its Coolidge, Arizona,
manufacturing facility can produce about 2,400 trucks per year
across three shifts, listed assets of between $500 million and
$1 billion. It estimated its liabilities were between $1 billion
and $10 billion, according to a filing with the U.S. bankruptcy
court for the district of Delaware.
    Nikola's cash and cash equivalents dropped sharply to $198.3
million at the end of September, compared with $464.7 million at
the end of 2023. On Wednesday, the company said it was entering
Chapter 11 proceedings with $47 million in cash on hand.
    The stock has fallen below the $1-mark several times and the
company resorted to a reverse stock split last year to comply
with Nasdaq's listing rules.
    Shortly after the company went public in 2020 through a
merger with a blank-check company, it was hit by a scathing
report by short-seller Hindenburg, which disbanded earlier this
year. Nikola had denied the allegations.
    Founder and then CEO Trevor Milton was convicted of fraud in
2022 and sentenced to four years in prison the following year.

       Feb 19 (Reuters) - 
    Nikola filed for 
    bankruptcy protection
     on Wednesday, the latest electric vehicle firm to shut
operations after grappling with tepid demand, rapid cash burn
and funding challenges.
  
        The move ends a challenging journey for the electric
truck maker which included several leadership changes, sinking
share value and short-seller allegations.   
  
        Here is a look at how EV startups have been faring in
the face of high interest rates and inflation, pushing them to
seek fresh capital to continue operations. 
  
        
  
        
    NIKOLA <NKLA.O> 
    Nikola is the latest EV maker to file for bankruptcy, after
a tumultuous journey in a highly competitive industry, wrought
with numerous vehicle issues and weak demand. 
        Nikola said it decided to initiate a sale process of its
assets to maximize value and ensure an orderly wind down.
  
        The firm will continue some operations for trucks in the
field and some hydrogen-fueling operations through the end of
March.
  
                
  
        FISKER  
  
        Fisker 
    filed for bankruptcy
     last year after experiencing weak demand for its Ocean SUVs
and facing competition from large players such as Tesla
<TSLA.O>.
    The collapse of its talks with an automaker - which Reuters
had reported to be Nissan <7201.T> - meant that it was denied
$350 million in funding from an unnamed investor that was
contingent on the automaker's investment and forced Fisker to
explore options.
    In its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in Delaware, Fisker's
operating unit, Fisker Group Inc, estimated assets of $500
million to $1 billion and liabilities of $100 million to $500
million.
        
  
        RIVIAN AUTOMOTIVE <RIVN.O> 
    Rivian is seen to be better placed than its rivals, thanks
in part to a joint venture with German automaker Volkswagen
Group <VOWG_p.DE>, which in November raised its funding amount
to $5.8 billion to develop electric vehicles and architecture. 
        
        LORDSTOWN MOTORS 
  
        Lordstown Motors 
    filed for bankruptcy protection
     in 2023 and put itself up for sale after failing to resolve
a dispute over a promised investment from Taiwan's Foxconn
<2354.TW>.
    In the complaint, Lordstown accused Foxconn of fraudulent
conduct and a series of broken promises in failing to abide by
an agreement to invest up to $170 million in the
electric-vehicle manufacturer.
            
  
        LUCID GROUP <LCID.O> 
    Lucid Group said in October it expects to raise $1.67
billion from a stock sale as it looks to ramp up production of
its new Gravity SUV. 
        The company is backed by Saudi Arabia's Public
Investment Fund, its largest shareholder, which also committed 
    $1.5 billion
     in cash in August last year.  
  
        
  
        CANOO
  
        Canoo said it 
    filed for bankruptcy
     under Chapter 7 last month, ceasing operations effective
immediately.
  
        The EV startup faced financial challenges and struggled
to raise additional funding from the U.S. Department of Energy's
Loan Programs Office amid uncertain demand for its
microbus-inspired cargo vans.
  
        
  
        PROTERRA
  
        Proterra filed for 
    Chapter 11 bankruptcy
     protection in 2023 due to slowing demand and financial
challenges.
  
        The company, which made electric buses as well as
battery systems, went public in 2021 through a merger with a
blank-check firm that valued it at $1.6 billion, including debt.

background throughout)
       Feb 19 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's X social media platform
is in talks to raise money from investors at a $44 billion
valuation, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing people
familiar with the matter.
    Musk bought X, formerly Twitter, for the same price in 2022,
but some investors including Fidelity Investments have sharply
written down the value of their stake as the platform struggled
to retain advertisers after the takeover.
         X did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The
reported talks come as valuations of Musk's other companies
soared after the victory of Donald Trump in the U.S.
presidential race. 
    Tesla shares have surged more than 40% since Trump's
victory, while SpaceX was valued at $350 billion in December.
Musk's AI startup, xAI, is also in talks to raise $10 billion at
a $75 billion valuation, up from $40 billion, according to
reports.
        Musk's close ties with Trump and return of some
advertisers to X have lifted expectations of better finances at
the platform. That has helped banks offload the debt they issued
to support Musk's Twitter buyout, a source told Reuters earlier
this month.
    Banks, led by Morgan Stanley, sold another chunky portion of
loans that formed the $13 billion debt supporting Musk's
acquisition, as the deal found broad interest from large fund
managers attracted by the prospect of improving revenue of X. 
    Talks for the new X financing round were still on and the
details could change, the Bloomberg News report said, adding
that this would be the first known investment round for the
social media company since Musk took it private.

       NEW DELHI, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Tesla <TSLA.O> has
selected locations for two showrooms in the Indian cities of New
Delhi and Mumbai, moving closer to its long-delayed plans to
sell its electric cars in the country, sources familiar with the
matter said.
    The U.S. carmaker has been hunting for showroom space in
India since late last year in order to start sales in the
world's third biggest auto market, after putting market entry
plans on hold in 2022.
    Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Tesla CEO Elon Musk
in the United States last week and discussed issues including
space, mobility and technology. 
    Tesla has selected space to lease in the Aerocity area near
New Delhi's international airport for a showroom, said two
people familiar with the discussions, who declined to be named
as the matter is private. 
    The Aerocity area boasts hotels, retail outlets and offices
of global corporations.
    In Mumbai, the carmaker has chosen space in the business and
retail hub of Bandra Kurla Complex near the city's airport, the
first person said. Both the Delhi and Mumbai showrooms will be
around 5,000 square feet (464.52 square metres) in size, the
source said.
    Opening dates for the outlets have not yet been decided, but
Tesla plans ""to sell imported EVs in India ... these deals are
for showrooms, not service centres,"" the first person said,
adding that Tesla will operate the outlets.
    Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    The company also posted job ads this week for 13 mid-level
roles in India, including some store and customer relationship
managers.
    Musk has long criticised India for having high import
tariffs of around 100% on EVs. Tesla has repeatedly lobbied to
relax them but has faced opposition from local automakers who
think Tesla's entry could hit their EV plans.
    U.S. President Donald Trump last week called out India's
high duty on cars, but agreed with Modi to work towards an early
trade deal and resolve their standoff over tariffs.

       Feb 18 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's Tesla <TSLA.O> is looking
to hire senior staff in India, job advertisements posted this
week showed, signalling progress in the electric vehicle maker's
plans to enter the world's third-biggest auto market.
    The postings come less than a week after Musk's meeting with
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington.
    Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for
comment.  
Tesla has for years planned an India market entry and even
setting up of local manufacturing. Some executives were hired
around 2022, though some top-level people quit the company after
Tesla put its India plans on hold back then.  
With the automaker again scouting for showroom space in India
since late last year, it has now listed 13 jobs on its website
and social media platform LinkedIn for various customer-facing
and back-end roles based in Mumbai, India's financial capital.
    Among them is a ""store manager"" role responsible for
overseeing and driving sales at the location, one job listing
showed, a sign that Tesla is looking to open a showroom in the
city. Delivery operations and customer support specialists are
also being sought, the ads showed.
The listings come just after Modi met Musk in the United States
last week, and discussed issues including space, mobility,
technology, and innovation.
Musk has long criticised India for having high import tariffs of
around 100% on EVs, and his company has repeatedly lobbied to
relax them. The move, however, has faced opposition from local
automakers who think Tesla's entry can hit their EV plans.
Last year, Musk was set to meet Modi during a trip to India
where he was expected to announce a potential $2 billion-$3
billion investment, but the visit was called off after Tesla
decided to lay off 10% of its global workforce amid declining
sales. 
In November, Reuters reported that Tesla was also scouting for
showroom space in the country's capital city of New Delhi, and
was in early stage talks with real estate developer DLF <DLF.NS>
to help secure a location.

    By Nora Eckert
       DETROIT, Feb 18 (Reuters) - About half the middle
managers at Ford Motor <F.N> will not get stock bonuses this
year in what is seen internally as CEO Jim Farley's latest
attempt to cut the automaker's bloated costs, according to six
people familiar with the matter.
    The stock awards are usually paid in March, but senior
managers have been told to select which half of their middle
management staff will receive them, four of the sources said. 
    Ford said the change was meant to incentivize an improvement
in employee performance. 
    ""We are focused on driving a high-performance culture that
recognizes and rewards employees for their business
contributions,"" a Ford spokesperson said.
The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker has struggled with inefficient
operations, within both its cash-burning electric vehicle
division and its fuel-powered vehicle business. 
    Farley has for years told employees and Wall Street that
Ford is undergoing a fundamental transformation to become leaner
and more competitive, as it races against U.S. rivals as well as
Chinese automakers and EV producer Tesla <TSLA.O>. 
Ford's stock slipped about 23% over the past year, while Detroit
rival General Motors' <GM.N> shares rose around 23% on the
strength of lower costs and higher profits.
    The automaker and its competitors are also navigating the
uncertainty of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies,
which Farley said have added ""a lot of cost and a lot of chaos.""
Ford's rivals are more exposed to tariffs on Mexico and Canada,
which are scheduled to begin March 1, but the company could
still be hit by 25% duties on vehicles shipped from Mexico,
including its Mustang Mach-E, Bronco Sport, and Maverick pickup.
     
    'THE BEST TALENT'
  
Employees were informed of the stock award changes in a company
briefing last week and told the rationale for slashing bonuses
was performance-based, the six sources said. 
Some Ford workers viewed the move as a way for the automaker to
slim its ranks, and said they were looking for job openings at
other companies.
""With continued profit underperformance versus GM, Farley
probably does not want to say the status quo of continued stock
awards for all managers is acceptable,"" David Whiston, analyst
for Morningstar, said in an email.
    ""This could be a way to get some people to quit given the
focus is on middle managers,"" Whiston added.
    Stock grant bonuses have typically been regarded as a way to
retain talent at the automaker, which Farley recently said was
key to its competitiveness. The awards vest over three years.
""The most important for me is the best talent and the best
culture,"" Farley told analysts on an earnings call this month,
saying the company could not improve its results without
recruiting and keeping the right people. 
     The stock awards are part of a larger performance-based
compensation system, which also includes cash awards. The
bonuses are granted to salaried employees companywide, most of
them managers. 
     Separately, Ford sets a companywide bonus based on metrics
including vehicle quality, total earnings and EV sales, which
amounted to 69% in 2024 of the total potential bonus, three of
the sources said. Reuters reported in October that those bonuses
would be cut based on lackluster company performance.

 (Adds White House comment)
    By Rachael Levy and Marisa Taylor
       Feb 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Food and Drug Administration
employees reviewing Elon Musk’s brain implant company Neuralink
were fired over the weekend as part of a broader purge of the
federal workforce, according to two sources with knowledge of
the matter.
    The cuts included about 20 people in the FDA’s office of
neurological and physical medicine devices, several of whom
worked on Neuralink, according to the two sources, who asked not
to be identified because of fear of professional repercussions. 
That division includes reviewers overseeing clinical-trial
applications by Neuralink and other companies making so-called
brain-computer interface devices, the sources said.
    Both sources said they did not believe the employees were
specifically targeted because of their work on Neuralink's
applications.   
    The loss of roughly 20 employees will hamper the agency’s
ability to quickly and safely process medical device
applications of all sorts, including Neuralink’s, according to
the sources and outside experts.
    “It’s intimidating to the FDA professionals who are
overseeing Neuralink’s trial,” said Victor Krauthamer, a former
FDA official for three decades, including a stint as acting
director of the office that reviews human-trial requests for
brain implants.
    “We should be worried about the whole trial, and the
protection of the people in the trial.""     
    In a response to questions, White House spokesman Kush Desai
told Reuters the Trump administration ""will abide by ethics
laws."" Trump has said that Musk will excuse himself from any
conflicts of interest between his various business interests and
his efforts to cut costs for the federal government. The FDA and
Musk did not respond to requests for comment. 
    Similar to other government agencies, the cuts affected
scientists reviewing medical device applications who were
probationary, one of the sources said. Probationary employees
typically have less than one year or in some cases less than two
years of service and have fewer legal protections.
    Neuralink is currently testing its device, which allows
paralyzed people to use digital devices solely via thought, in a
small number of disabled patients. The company is also working
on an implant aimed at restoring vision. Last year, the FDA gave
that device a designation aimed at speeding up development and
federal review, the company has said. 
    After spending more than $250 million to get President
Donald Trump re-elected, Musk has been leading a sweeping effort
to cut government spending, including at agencies that regulate
his companies, such as Tesla <TSLA.O> and SpaceX.
    The dismissal letters sent to the FDA reviewers cited
performance reasons, even though the employees had no issues on
their prior performance, and had received top-notch rankings
several weeks ago, according to the two sources familiar with
the matter. The supervisors of the cut employees weren’t
consulted before the mass layoffs and found out from their
employees, the sources said.

2025-02-18 13:35:32,"TESLA FINALISES LOCATIONS FOR NEW DELHI, MUMBAI SHOWROOMS AS IT PLANS TO START INDIA SALES, SOURCES SAY",urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250218:nL3N3P90VT:1,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"By Aditya Kalra
       NEW DELHI, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Tesla <TSLA.O> has
selected locations for two showrooms in the Indian cities of New
Delhi and Mumbai, moving closer to its long-delayed plans to
sell its electric cars in the country, sources familiar with the
matter said.
    The U.S. carmaker has been hunting for showroom space in
India since late last year in order to start sales in the
world's third biggest auto market, after putting market entry
plans on hold in 2022.
    Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Tesla CEO Elon Musk
in the United States last week and discussed issues including
space, mobility and technology. 
    Tesla has selected space to lease in the Aerocity area near
New Delhi's international airport for a showroom, said two
people familiar with the discussions, who declined to be named
as the matter is private. 
    The Aerocity area boasts hotels, retail outlets and offices
of global corporations.
    In Mumbai, the carmaker has chosen space in the business and
retail hub of Bandra Kurla Complex near the city's airport, the
first person said. Both the Delhi and Mumbai showrooms will be
around 5,000 square feet (464.52 square metres) in size, the
source said.
    Opening dates for the outlets have not yet been decided, but
Tesla plans ""to sell imported EVs in India ... these deals are
for showrooms, not service centres,"" the first person said,
adding that Tesla will operate the outlets.
    Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    The company also posted job ads this week for 13 mid-level
roles in India, including some store and customer relationship
managers.
    Musk has long criticised India for having high import
tariffs of around 100% on EVs. Tesla has repeatedly lobbied to
relax them but has faced opposition from local automakers who
think Tesla's entry could hit their EV plans.
    U.S. President Donald Trump last week called out India's
high duty on cars, but agreed with Modi to work towards an early

      State's corporate court has come under attack by Musk
    

  
    By Tom Hals
       WILMINGTON, Delaware, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Delaware
lawmakers on Monday proposed changes to the U.S. state's widely
used corporate law that would limit shareholder lawsuits after
several high-profile companies said they might move their legal
home to another state.
    The bill sets out steps that corporate boards could take to
insulate directors and controlling shareholders from litigation
over alleged conflicts. The bill would also limit the kinds of
internal records that shareholders can access, which they need
to build their cases. The bill is sponsored by leaders of both
parties in both houses of Delaware's state assembly.
    Delaware's corporate law governs relations between company
boards and their investors for around two-thirds of the S&P500
index. Companies tend to charter their businesses in the state
for its stable law and well-respected courts and the fees those
companies pay to the state generate around a third of Delaware's
general budget revenue. 
        But several companies, including Meta Platforms
<META.O>, Dropbox <DBX.O> and Bill Ackman's management company,
recently have said they were moving or considering moving their
incorporation out of Delaware, which prompted the bill,
according to the sponsor, Delaware state Senator Bryan Townsend,
a Democrat and senate majority leader.
    ""And it also comes at a time when you have a couple other
jurisdictions in particular that are seeming to gain some
traction with being viewed as legitimate alternatives to
Delaware,"" Townsend told Reuters.
    Texas has established a business court that is meant to
rival Delaware's Court of Chancery for specializing in business
and investor disputes. Elon Musk's Tesla <TSLA.O> and SpaceX
moved their state of incorporation to Texas from Delaware after
a Chancery judge last year ordered Musk's $56 billion pay
package from Tesla to be rescinded.
    Townsend said he'd like to move quickly on the bill, which
he said was drafted with input from the state's recently elected
Governor Matt Meyer, a Democrat. The bill was not drafted by the
state's bar association, which typically oversees changes to the
state's corporate law.
    Townsend said the bill would not change the case challenging
Musk's pay, which is on appeal before the Delaware Supreme
Court. ""This has nothing to do with Elon Musk. And I'll note
that this legislation is not retroactive,"" Townsend said.
        Townsend also introduced a bill that asked the state bar
association to prepare a report on awarding attorneys fees.
Delaware judges have awarded several fees that were among the
largest ever in the past two years.
    In recent years, several corporate leaders who lost costly
cases in the Court of Chancery have attacked the state's
judiciary, most notably Musk. Another outspoken critic was Phil
Shawe, who was embroiled in a long-running case over control of
TransPerfect, a translation provider. Shawe has run ad campaigns
in local media criticizing Chancery judges and was a leading
proponent of Meyer's campaign for governor.
    Several rulings in recent years have held controlling
shareholders liable over deals that corporate lawyers thought
were properly structured, fueling criticism that the state was
becoming too favorable to shareholder lawyers.
State lawmakers took the unusual step last year of amending the
corporate law in response to three rulings before those cases
had even been appealed, which was widely criticized by
academics.  
    Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate law at Tulane Law
School, said Monday's bill would make shareholder litigation in
Delaware ""dramatically less successful.""
    The exact impact of that is unclear. Some experts argue
shareholder lawsuits prevent the worst board room abuses and
self-dealing. But others say litigation acts as kind of tax on
companies that rarely results in much benefit for shareholders
and that the real policing of corporate boards comes from
institutional investors such as large pension funds.
    However, the administration of Republican President Donald
Trump may loosen federal securities regulations and place
constraints on the ability of institutional investors to apply
pressure to corporate boards. ""That mechanism is failing at
exactly the same time,"" Lipton said.

plans to build a 1.4 gigawatt battery storage facility in the
port of Vlissingen by 2027, it said on Tuesday, using 372 of
Tesla's Megapack 2 XL grid storage batteries, in what will be
the Netherlands' largest such project to date.
    Such batteries will be needed to balance the Netherlands'
power grid as the country's plans to build 21 GW of offshore
wind energy by 2032 are expected to lead to frequent electricity
surpluses in the morning and evening.
    Return said the 350 million euro ($366 million) project,
dubbed ""Mufasa"", will be able to discharge at 350MW, enough to
power 200,000 households, several times a day. Investors include
Macquarie Capital, Belgium's TINC <TINCC.BR>, the company's
existing investors, and a consortium of six banks.
    Eneco, Mitsubishi Corp of Japan's Dutch energy subsidiary,
will operate the facility once it is complete, an Eneco

2025-02-18 06:29:17,"Tesla steps up India hiring after Musk-Modi meet, fast-tracking market entry plan",urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250218:nL3N3P90AQ:1,NS:RTRS,TSLA.O,"Feb 18 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's Tesla <TSLA.O> is looking
to hire senior staff in India, job advertisements posted this
week showed, signalling progress in the electric vehicle maker's
plans to enter the world's third-biggest auto market.
    The postings come less than a week after Musk's meeting with
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington.
    Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for
comment.  
Tesla has for years planned an India market entry and even
setting up of local manufacturing. Some executives were hired
around 2022, though some top-level people quit the company after
Tesla put its India plans on hold back then.  
With the automaker again scouting for showroom space in India
since late last year, it has now listed 13 jobs on its website
and social media platform LinkedIn for various customer-facing
and back-end roles based in Mumbai, India's financial capital.
    Among them is a ""store manager"" role responsible for
overseeing and driving sales at the location, one job listing
showed, a sign that Tesla is looking to open a showroom in the
city. Delivery operations and customer support specialists are
also being sought, the ads showed.
The listings come just after Modi met Musk in the United States
last week, and discussed issues including space, mobility,
technology, and innovation.
Musk has long criticised India for having high import tariffs of
around 100% on EVs, and his company has repeatedly lobbied to
relax them. The move, however, has faced opposition from local
automakers who think Tesla's entry can hit their EV plans.
Last year, Musk was set to meet Modi during a trip to India
where he was expected to announce a potential $2 billion-$3
billion investment, but the visit was called off after Tesla
decided to lay off 10% of its global workforce amid declining
sales. 
In November, Reuters reported that Tesla was also scouting for
showroom space in the country's capital city of New Delhi, and
was in early stage talks with real estate developer DLF <DLF.NS>
to help secure a location.

<002594.SZ> <1211.HK> over its move to offer free smart driving
features across most of its line-up have flooded a prominent
Chinese auto quality platform, many from customers who said they
had overpaid for their cars.    
    Over 4,700 complaints were filed against BYD cars between
February 11-17 on 12365auto.com, a third-party auto consumer
complaints platform, compared with about 150 the week before and
roughly 500 for January.
    BYD cars, including ones from its best-selling Ocean and
Dynasty series, also took the top 10 spots on a list the
platform publishes that ranks models by the number of complaints
received. 
    One complaint, sent in by an owner of a Seal 06 DM-i plug-in
hybrid sedan, said they had repeatedly asked the salesperson
when buying the car if a newer model would be launched this
year.
    ""But only half a month after I picked up the car, the new
model hit the market with notable upgrades in configuration at
the same price,"" the person said, adding that they wanted free
upgrades and other compensation from the company. 
    The platform showed BYD responding to say that the company
had passed on the complaint to the relevant company departments.
        BYD did not respond to a request for comment.
    The complaints are one of the ripple effects a prolonged
price war and hyper competitiveness in the Chinese market are
having as automakers slash prices, offer free features or
incentives, or roll out new models at a pace faster than other
countries. 
    Two years ago, U.S. automaker Tesla, shortly after it cut
prices in a move that started the price war, saw hundreds of
Tesla <TSLA.O> owners assemble at the company's showrooms and
distribution centres in China, seeking rebates and credits.

       WASHINGTON, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation
Administration fired fewer than 400 employees out of its
workforce of 45,000, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on
Monday, as questions rise around air traffic safety amid a spate
of recent plane accidents.
    Duffy posted the number of layoffs in a social media post
message on X, formerly known as Twitter, responding to a post by
his Democratic predecessor Pete Buttigieg, who has been critical
of the Trump administration's Department of Transportation. 
    ""Less than 400 were let go, and they were all probationary,
meaning they had been hired less than a year ago. Zero air
traffic controllers and critical safety personnel were let go,""
Duffy wrote on Monday.
    The Trump administration sent air traffic controllers buyout
offers but later said they were not eligible, also declaring
other safety officials, including TSA officers, ineligible. The
FAA remains about 3,500 controllers short of targeted staffing
levels.
    The Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union said
Saturday the FAA had fired several hundred probationary FAA
employees.
    The union said Monday it believed just under 300 FAA workers
it represents were fired, including maintenance mechanics,
aeronautical information specialists, aviation safety assistants
and management and program assistants.
    ""These are positions that are vital to supporting public
safety,"" a union spokeswoman said.
    The FAA and Transportation Department have declined to say
what jobs the fired workers held or why they were fired.
    The disclosure came on the same day that Elon Musk's
government downsizing team DOGE was visiting the FAA's Air
Traffic Control command center in Warrenton, Virginia, Duffy
said. 
    Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate
Commerce Committee, on Monday slammed the Trump administration
for firing FAA employees who inspect and maintain air traffic
control communications, radio and computer systems - especially
after a series of fatal crashes.  
    “The FAA is already short 800 technicians and these firings
inject unnecessary risk into the airspace — in the aftermath of
four deadly crashes in the last month,"" she said.
    USDOT said Monday FAA ""continues to hire and onboard air
traffic controllers and safety professionals, including
mechanics and others who support them.""
    Duffy said on X that the Trump administration plans to
overhaul what he called ""our outdated, World War II-era air
traffic control system.""

       March 3 (Reuters) - Apple won a ruling dismissing a
lawsuit that accused the iPhone maker of illegally monopolizing
the market for digital storage, causing consumers to pay more
for its iCloud service.
    U.S. District Judge Eumi Lee in San Jose, California, on
Friday said the plaintiffs in the class action had not shown
Apple violated federal or state antitrust law. However, she
ruled they could amend their complaint and refile it.
    The lawsuit alleged Apple violated antitrust law by coercing
customers to use the company’s iCloud service to back up core
data and device setting files. Apple has denied any wrongdoing.
    Lee said in her ruling that consumers are not required to
purchase cloud storage from Apple. The judge also said the
plaintiffs’ claims did not plausibly show Apple as having any
monopoly power in the cloud storage market.
    Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Steve Berman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said they intend
to file an amended lawsuit that addresses the judge's concerns.
    The lawsuit was filed in March 2024 on behalf of a Los
Angeles resident who said she was paying $2.99 monthly for an
iCloud storage plan. Her lawyers want to represent a nationwide
class of at least tens of millions of consumers who purchased
iCloud storage plans.
    Apple allows third-party storage for photos and videos but
not for users' restricted data files that are needed to
“restore” an Apple device. In seeking dismissal of the lawsuit,
Apple said its policy was designed to guarantee high levels of
security.
    Lee said in her ruling that “if anything, Apple’s allegedly
high prices would incentivize rivals to increase production to
take share from Apple.”
    
    The case is Julianna Felix Gamboa et al v. Apple Inc., U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California, No.
5:24-cv-01270.
    For plaintiffs: Steve Berman and Ben Harrington of Hagens
Berman Sobol Shapiro
    For Apple: Belinda Lee and Sarah Ray of Latham & Watkins

       Feb 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump likened
the UK government's demand that Apple <AAPL.O> grant it access
to some user data as ""something that you hear about with China,""
in an interview with The Spectator political magazine published
Friday.
    Trump said that he had told British Prime Minister Keir
Starmer that he ""can't do this"", referring to the request for
access to data. The two met at the White House on Thursday for
the first time since the U.S. leader took office, discussing
Ukraine and negotiating a bilateral trade agreement.
    ""We actually told him (Starmer) ... that's incredible.
That's something, you know, that you hear about with China,""
Trump said in his first magazine interview of his second term
with the magazine's editor-at-large Ben Domenech.
    A spokesperson for the British government said ""we have a
close intelligence relationship with the U.S. and we take the
partnership seriously"" but did not comment on the specifics of
the Apple case. The company did not respond to a Reuters request
for comment.
    Apple last week ended an advanced security encryption
feature for cloud data for UK users in an unprecedented response
to government demands for access to user data. A spokesperson
for Britain's Home Office had then declined to comment on
whether such an order had been issued.
    In a letter dated February 25 to two U.S. lawmakers, Tulsi
Gabbard, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said the
U.S. is examining whether the UK government had violated the
CLOUD Act, which bars it from issuing demands for the data of
U.S. citizens and vice versa.
    The Spectator, which is influential in Conservative circles
and was previously edited by former Prime Minister Boris
Johnson, was bought last year by British hedge fund founder Paul
Marshall.

       Feb 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended higher on Friday
after a choppy trading session, with Dell Technologies dipping
and other tech stocks climbing after a meeting between the U.S.
President Donald Trump and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr
Zelenskiy ended in disaster.
    Zelenskiy and Trump traded verbal blows at the White House
before the world's media. This created fresh uncertainty over
Ukraine's war with Russia for investors already worried about
sticky U.S. inflation and a tepid economy. 
    The S&P 500 moved lower immediately after the clash before
recovering and ending the day with a gain.
    Zelenskiy left the White House without signing a
much-vaunted deal between Ukraine and the U.S. over the joint
development of natural resources.
    ""The news, if you watched it live, it was pretty worrisome.
It got heated, and Zelenskiy is considered an ally of the U.S.,""
said Adam Sarhan, chief executive at 50 Park Investments.
""That's why the market sold off, but then cooler heads
prevailed. Zelenskiy either is going to make a deal or he's
not.""    
    Dell <DELL.N> dropped 4.7% after the PC maker forecast a
decline in its adjusted gross margin rate for fiscal 2026.
    Peer HP Inc <HPQ.N> fell 6.8% after its quarterly profit
forecasts missed expectations.
    Nvidia <NVDA.O> and Tesla <TSLA.O> rose almost 4% each and
lifted the S&P 500.
        The S&P 500 climbed 1.59% to end the session at 5,954.50
points.
  
        The Nasdaq gained 1.63% to 18,847.28 points, while the
Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.39% to 43,840.91 points.
  
        Volume on U.S. exchanges was heavy, with 17.5 billion
shares traded, compared to an average of 15.4 billion shares
over the previous 20 sessions.
  
        All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, led by financials
<.SPSY>, up 2.1%, followed by a 1.8% gain in consumer
discretionary <.SPLRCD>.
  
        For the week, the S&P 500 fell about 1%, the Nasdaq lost
3.5% and the Dow climbed almost 1%. 
  
        The Nasdaq lost about 4% for all of February, its
deepest monthly loss since April 2024. The S&P 500 fell 1.45%
for the month and the Dow lost 1.6%.
  
    Earlier, a Commerce Department report showed inflation rose
in January in line with expectations. However, consumer
spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the
economy, dropped 0.2% after an upwardly revised 0.8% increase in
December. This could complicate the Federal Reserve's
deliberations on monetary policy.
    ""Spending came in lower than we were looking for... most of
it I would attribute to a cooling economy, which presents a
dilemma for the Fed in the sense that you still have inflation
and you have an economy that is moving lower. If you add them
together, that equals stagflation,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief
market economist at Spartan Capital Securities.
    Friday's report is important for investors trying to gauge
the next move for the central bank after policymakers reiterated
a hawkish stance. Investors worry Trump's policies, especially
trade restrictions, could exacerbate U.S. inflation.
    ""Tariff talk certainly is having a negative effect on the
stock market, and it probably will keep a lid on stock market
advances until there's more clarity around that,"" said Sam
Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.
    Traders see the Fed lowering borrowing costs twice by
December, little changed from before the report, according to
data compiled by LSEG. Investors will assess comments from
Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee later in the day. 
    The CBOE Volatility Index <.VIX>, also known as Wall
Street's fear gauge, touched a one-month high and was last up at

500 <.AD.SPX> by a 7.1-to-one ratio.
  
        The S&P 500 posted 39 new highs and 14 new lows; the
Nasdaq recorded 43 new highs and 332 new lows.

2025-02-28 12:15:46,FACTBOX-US companies scale back and modify diversity policies after Trump's order,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250228:nL3N3PJ0X2:1,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"(Adds Pfizer, EPAM)
       Feb 28 (Reuters) - From Google to Target, many major
U.S. companies have dropped or considered altering their
diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies following
President Donald Trump's executive order to curtail such
programs at the federal and private level.
    Even before Trump took office, big corporations were under
increasing pressure from conservative groups to cut back or
tweak their DEI policies aimed at boosting racial and ethnic
representation at the workplace.
        Here are some of the companies that have already
scrapped their DEI policies or are facing pressure to modify the
language around such programs on their websites and regulatory
filings:
    
 Company       Statement
 Starbucks     In March 2024, the coffee giant's shareholders
 <SBUX.O>      voted for an executive compensation plan that
               dropped a bonus related to DEI goals.
 Tractor       The company in late June said that it would no
 Supply        longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign
 <TSCO.O>      (HRC), which advocates for LGBTQ rights.
               Tractor Supply also said it would eliminate DEI
               roles and retire its current DEI goals.
 Deere <DE.N>  The company said in July it would not
               participate in or support external social or
               cultural awareness parades, festivals, or
               events. The farm equipment maker also
               reaffirmed that the existence of diversity
               quotas and pronoun identification have never
               been and are not company policy.
 Harley-David  In August, the motorcycle manufacturer said it
 son <HOG.N>   would not participate in the HRC survey and had
               ended its DEI initiatives.
 Brown-Forman  The Jack Daniel's maker said it would ensure
 <Bfb.N>       executive incentives and employee goals are
               tied to business performance, end participation
               in the HRC survey and scrap its quantitative
               workforce and supplier diversity goals.
 Lowe's        The home improvement chain will no longer
 <LOW.N>       participate in HRC surveys and will combine its
               various business resource groups that represent
               diverse employees into one umbrella
               organization. Lowe's said in August it would
               not sponsor or participate in community events
               such as parades, festivals, or fairs.
 Ford Motor    The automaker said it will change its DEI
 <F.N>         program, including ending participation in an
               LGBTQ advocacy group's ranking system.
 Molson Coors  The beer maker said it will end participation
 Beverage      in the HRC index, and will tie executive
 <TAP.N>       incentives to business performance and not
               aspirational representation goals beginning
               this year. 
 Boeing        The planemaker has dismantled its global
 <BA.N>        diversity, equity and inclusion department
               according to Bloomberg News. Boeing's diversity
               vice president Sara Liang Bowen announced in
               October on LinkedIn that she had left the
               company.
 Walmart       The retail bellwether will no longer consider
 <WMT.N>       race and gender to boost diversity when
               granting supplier contracts and is scaling back
               racial equity training. Walmart is also
               stopping participation in rankings by HRC and
               also reviewing its support for Pride and other
               events.
 Meta          The social media company ended its DEI
 Platforms     programs, including those for hiring, training
 <META.O>      and picking suppliers. 
 Amazon.com    The ecommerce giant was ""winding down outdated
 <AMZN.O>      programs and materials"" as part of a review of
               hundreds of initiatives, according to a memo
               sent to employees in December.
 McDonald's    The fast-food chain is retiring its goal for
 <MCD.N>       diversity in corporate leadership and shifting
               away from some diversity practices. McDonald's 
               also said the company's diversity team will now
               be called its ""global inclusion team.""
 Apple         The iPhone maker's board recommended investors
 <AAPL.O>      vote against a shareholder proposal by National
               Center for Public Policy - a conservative
               think-tank - to abolish the company's DEI
               programs.
 Target        The big-box retailer said in January it was
 <TGT.N>       ending its DEI  program and Racial Equity
               Action and Change (REACH) initiatives this
               year, which included plans to add more than 500

paragraph 13)
    By Stephen Nellis
       Feb 27 (Reuters) - Apple <AAPL.O> on Thursday said it
will introduce a way for parents to share the age of a child
with app developers without revealing sensitive information such
as birthdays or government identification numbers.
    The move comes as a number of U.S. state and federal
lawmakers consider age-verification laws for social media and
other apps. 
    States, such as Utah and South Carolina, are currently
debating laws that would require app store operators such as
Apple and Alphabet's <GOOGL.O> Google to check the ages of
users.
    That has set up a conflict in the tech industry over which
party should be responsible for checking ages for users under 18
- app stores, or each individual app. 
    Meta <META.O>, for instance, has long argued in favor of
legislation requiring app stores to check ages when a child
downloads an app.
    Apple on Thursday said it does not want to be responsible
for collecting sensitive data for those age verifications.
    ""While only a fraction of apps on the App Store may require
age verification, all users would have to hand over their
sensitive personally identifying information to us—regardless of
whether they actually want to use one of these limited set of
apps,"" Apple wrote in a whitepaper on its website.
    As an alternative, Apple said it will roll out what it calls
""age assurance."" Using it, parents will be able to input a
child's age when setting up a child's account. 
    The parent can then choose to allow the child to share what
Apple calls a ""declared age range"" - rather than an exact
birthday or other identifying information - with third-party app
developers. The parent will have the ability to turn off
age-range sharing.
    ""This protects privacy by keeping parents in control of
their kids’ sensitive personal information, while minimizing the
amount of information that is shared with third parties,"" Apple
said in its paper.
    In a statement, Stephanie Otway, a Meta spokeswoman, said
the Apple technology is ""a positive first step"" but it still
requires the child to share age range data with the developer,
which will make it more difficult for Meta to put to use.
    ""Parents tell us they want to have the final say over the
apps their teens use, and that’s why we support legislation that
requires app stores to verify a child’s age and get a parent’s
approval before their child downloads an app,” Otway said.
    Apple's existing controls already require parental approval
for children to download an app.

       WASHINGTON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. House Judiciary
Committee has subpoenaed eight major technology companies,
including Alphabet <GOOGL.O>, Meta <META.O>, Apple <AAPL.O> and
X Corp, seeking details about their communications with other
countries over fears of foreign censorship, it said on Thursday.
    House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, a Republican,
sent the subpoenas on Wednesday and also included Amazon
<AMZN.O>, Microsoft <MSFT.O>, Rumble <RUM.O> and TikTok,
according to the statement.
    ""The Committee must understand how and to what extent
foreign governments have limited Americans' access to lawful
speech in the United States,"" Jordan said in a statement
announcing the subpoenas.  
    A Microsoft spokesperson said the company is engaged with
the committee and committed to working in good faith.
    Tim Murtaugh, a spokesperson for Rumble, said the company
had received the subpoena. ""We look forward to sharing
information related to the ongoing efforts of numerous
governments around the globe who seek to suppress the innate
human right to self-expression,"" he said.
    Spokespeople for the other companies did not immediately
respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
    Jordan pointed to laws in the United Kingdom and other
countries in Europe, as well as a proposed law in Australia that
could require U.S. tech platforms to remove content deemed
harmful by foreign regulators.
The concern is the restrictions could affect what content
companies allow in the U.S., Jordan wrote.
    The subpoenas seek information on the companies' compliance
with foreign laws, regulations, or judicial orders.

    By Jonathan Stempel
       Feb 27 (Reuters) - Apple <AAPL.O> has been sued by
consumers who said its claim that three versions of Apple
Watches are ""carbon neutral"" and environmentally friendly is
false and misleading.
    In a complaint filed on Wednesday in San Jose, California
federal court, seven purchasers of the green-tagged Apple Watch
Series 9, SE and Ultra 2 said they would not have bought their
watches or would have paid less had they known the truth.
    Apple, also known for the iPhone, launched the watches in
September 2023, saying they would be carbon neutral through a
combination of lower emissions and purchases of carbon offsets.
    But the plaintiffs--from California, Florida and Washington,
D.C.--said two carbon offsetting projects on which Apple relied
to meet its corporate emissions target did not provide ""genuine""
carbon reductions.
    They said much of the land in Kenya's Chyulu Hills Project
lies within a national park protected from deforestation since
1983, while land for China's Guinan Project was heavily covered
by trees even before the project began in 2015.
    ""In both cases, the carbon reductions would have occurred
regardless of Apple's involvement or the projects' existence,""
the complaint said. ""Because Apple's carbon neutrality claims
are predicated on the efficacy and legitimacy of these projects,
Apple’s carbon neutrality claims are false and misleading.""
    The plaintiffs also said 70% of U.S. and Canadian consumers
consider environmental sustainability crucial when making
purchases, citing a study by the National Retail Federation and
IBM.
    In a statement on Thursday responding to the lawsuit, Apple
did not discuss the case but defended its environmental record.
    ""We've drastically cut emissions for Apple Watch by over
75%, and we are investing significantly in nature-based projects
to remove hundreds of thousands of metric tons of carbon from
the air,"" it said. ""We detail our work prominently and
transparently for our users.""
    The Cupertino, California-based company has aimed to be
carbon neutral by 2030, including in its supply chain.
    Wednesday's lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and an
injunction blocking Apple from marketing the three watches as
carbon neutral.
    The case is Dib et al v Apple Inc, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California, No. 25-02043.

       PARIS, Feb 27 (Reuters) - French prosecutors have closed
a case filed by Democratic Republic of Congo accusing Apple
<AAPL.O> subsidiaries of using conflict minerals in its supply
chain, according to a document seen by Reuters on Thursday.
    Congo filed criminal complaints against Apple subsidiaries
in France and Belgium, its lawyers said in December. Apple said
then it strongly disputed the allegations and had told its
suppliers they must not use the minerals in question sourced
from Congo or Rwanda.
    In the document seen by Reuters and dated February 18, the
Paris prosecutor's office said allegations of money laundering
and deceptive business practices were ""not sufficiently
well-founded"" and closed the case - meaning it will not proceed
with the complaint.
    The office invited Congo to contact a different office ""with
jurisdiction over war crimes"". 
    The prosecutor's office and Apple did not immediately
respond to an emailed request for comment on Thursday.
    William Bourdon and Vincent Brengarth, lawyers working for
Congo in France, described the decision as a ""very partial
dismissal"" that they intended to challenge, citing the ""extreme
seriousness of the facts denounced and the need to identify and
prosecute those responsible."" 
    Congo is a major source of tin, tantalum and tungsten,
so-called 3T minerals used in computers and mobile phones. Some
artisanal mines are run by armed groups involved in massacres of
civilians, mass rapes, looting and other crimes, according to
U.N. experts and human rights groups.
    Since the 1990s, Congo's mining heartlands in the east have
been devastated by waves of fighting between armed groups, some
backed by neighbouring Rwanda, and the Congolese military.
    The complaints filed in France and Belgium were prepared on
behalf of Congo's justice minister. Belgium appointed an
investigating magistrate in response, a lawyer for Congo said in
January.

       ROME, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Italy urged that there be no
backtracking on a major international taxation agreement at the
G20 talks in South Africa, Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti
said on Thursday, adding that unilateral approaches would
discourage investment.
    U.S. President Donald Trump last month declared that a
global corporate minimum tax deal reached in 2021 had ""no force
or effect"" in the U.S., effectively pulling out of the landmark
arrangement negotiated by Joe Biden's administration with nearly
140 countries.
    ""Unilateral and uncoordinated approaches would create
tensions between countries and an uncertain fiscal environment
that would discourage investments,"" Giorgetti said at the
meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers in Cape
Town, according to a statement issued by his office.
    The European Union, Britain and other countries have adopted
the 15% global corporate minimum tax, but the U.S. Congress
never approved measures to bring Washington into compliance with
it.
    The U.S. has a roughly 10% global minimum tax, part of
Trump's landmark 2017 tax cut package.
    Countries that have adopted the 15% global minimum tax may
be in a position to collect a ""top-up"" tax from U.S. companies
paying a lower rate. Trump's administration has referred to such
actions as retaliatory.
    ""We can certainly work to simplify the overall minimum tax
to facilitate wider implementation,"" Giorgetti said.
    Trump also ordered his trade chief to revive investigations
aimed at imposing tariffs on imports from countries that levy
digital service taxes on U.S. technology companies.
    The digital service taxes aimed at dominant U.S. tech giants
including Alphabet's Google <GOOGL.O>, Meta's Facebook <META.O>,
Apple <AAPL.O> and Amazon <AMZN.O> have been a longstanding
trade irritant for multiple U.S. administrations.

       Feb 27 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs <GS.N> has dropped an
entire section dedicated to ""diversity and inclusion"" from its
annual filing released on Thursday, as Wall Street firms dial
back their diversity initiatives after President Donald Trump
took charge.
    ""We have made certain adjustments to reflect developments in
the law in the U.S.,"" CEO David Solomon said in a statement.
    The bank's previously set five-year ""aspirational hiring and
representation goals"" are set to expire this year, the report
stated.
    Earlier this month, Goldman ended a four-year-old diversity
policy that called for the bank to advise companies on IPOs only
if they had two diverse board members.
    Corporate America has softened its stance on diversity,
equity and inclusion in recent weeks after Trump issued an
executive order last month directing government agency chiefs to
dismantle DEI policies at federal agencies and in the private
sector.
    ""We strongly believe that merit and diversity are not
mutually exclusive. Our people are a powerful example of that
and that’s why we will continue to focus on the importance of
attracting and retaining diverse, exceptional talent,"" Solomon
said.
    Supporters of DEI policies say the initiatives seek to
redress longstanding bias, inequity and discrimination. Trump
and his allies say DEI unfairly discriminates against other
Americans, including white people and men, and weakens the
importance of merit in job hiring or promotion.
    Trump on Wednesday also asked Apple <AAPL.O> to scrap its
DEI policies after the tech giant's shareholders voted to keep
them.
    Citigroup <C.N> last week also dropped a requirement for

       BRUSSELS, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Apple <AAPL.O> is facing a
likely antitrust fine as the French regulator prepares to rule
next month on the company's privacy control tool, two people
with direct knowledge of the matter said.
    Called App Tracking Transparency (ATT), the feature allows
iPhone users to decide which apps can track user activity,
helping companies like Meta Platforms' <META.O> Facebook and
online advertisers tailor ads to users and measure their impact.
     Digital advertising and mobile gaming companies including
Facebook say it has made it more expensive and difficult for
brands to advertise on Apple's platforms.
    The French regulator charged Apple in 2023, saying it was
concerned that the company might ""abuse its dominant position by
implementing discriminatory, non-objective and non-transparent
conditions for the use of user data for advertising purposes"".
    It is expected to issue its decision next month ordering
Apple to halt its anti-competitive practice and will likely
impose a fine too, the people said, making it the first
regulatory veto against the ATT.
    French antitrust fines can be as much as 10% of a company's
global annual revenue.
    ""The decision is expected in the spring. But we can't
comment any further,"" the regulator said.
    Apple referred to a July 2023 statement in which it said it
holds its advertising business to a higher standard of privacy
than it requires of any other developer and that it had
previously received strong support from the French regulator and
privacy watchdog on the goal of the ATT.
    The German antitrust authority earlier this month charged
Apple with abusing its market power through its app tracking
tool and giving itself preferential treatment, putting the
company at risk of a hefty fine.

 (Updates Feb. 26 story with Frankfurt-listed shares)
    By Aditya Soni, Noel Randewich and Rae Wee
       Feb 27 (Reuters) - Nvidia's <NVDA.O> quarterly outlook
on Wednesday suggested demand from Microsoft <MSFT.O>, Amazon
<AMZN.O> and other heavyweight tech companies racing to build
out AI infrastructure remains robust, though the outcome failed
to significantly quell fears of overspending in the booming
industry.
    Shares of Nvidia edged down 0.18% in Frankfurt on Thursday,
having fallen 1.5% in extended trade in New York on Wednesday
after the dominant AI chipmaker forecast quarterly revenue above
analysts' estimates. Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms <META.O>
and Alphabet <GOOGL.O>, among Nvidia's largest customers, were
mostly unchanged.
    Shares of those companies, among the components of the
so-called ""Magnificent Seven"", have delivered big returns as
they raced to dominate emerging AI technology following the
debut of ChatGPT in November 2022. 
    More recently, most of those stocks have stumbled and
investors have become more cautious, especially after China's
DeepSeek said it achieved significant AI performance at low
cost. 
    While Nvidia delivered a 78% surge in quarterly revenue, it
said its first-quarter margin would tighten to about 71% from
73.5%, lower than the 72.2% estimated by analysts, as it ramps
production of its new flagship Blackwell AI chips.
    ""Despite market jitters over DeepSeek's efficient model and
early Blackwell deployment challenges, Nvidia's results reaffirm
that it continues to lead the AI landscape,"" said Jacob Bourne,
an analyst at eMarketer. ""Competitors are making strides but
frontier models require the kind of advanced computing resources
that Nvidia provides."" 
    Still, the highly anticipated earnings report from Nvidia
was met with lacklustre response from technology companies in
Asia on Thursday.
    Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC)
<2330.TW>, Nvidia's main supplier of chips, slipped 0.47%, while
South Korean chipmakers Samsung Electronics <005930.KS> and SK
Hynix <000660.KS> fell 0.18% and 1%, respectively.
    Tokyo's Nikkei technology sub-index was up 0.2%.
    ""Nvidia's earnings came with much less volatility than
expected. The absence of major surprises may have kept sentiment
relatively calm,"" said Yeap Jun Rong, a market strategist at IG.
    
    LOSING SHINE
    The launch of low-cost AI models from DeepSeek last month
raised fears of a pullback in spending on Nvidia's priciest AI
chips and evaporated more than half a trillion dollars of its
stock market value in a single day, a record on Wall Street. 
    Adding to worries, an analyst report suggested Microsoft was
scrapping some data center leases.
    The Magnificent Seven stocks have retreated from their
late-2024 peaks and the group is in correction territory, with
the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF <MAGS.K> down more than 11%
from its December 17 closing high. 
   
    

    Nvidia has routinely exceeded analyst estimates over the
last two years, but the magnitude of its revenue beats has
narrowed as it faces tough comparisons from strong growth a year
ago. 
    ""DeepSeek rattled investors but given Nvidia's first-mover
advantage and the huge infrastructure investment plans from tech
giants like Meta, it's an indication that Nvidia's high-end
chips will remain in demand,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of
money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.
     Magnificent Seven stocks added roughly $11 trillion in
market capitalization between the debut of ChatGPT in November
2022 and their combined peak in mid-December 2024, with Nvidia
adding $2.7 trillion in market value, making it the world's
second-most valuable company at $3.2 trillion.
    Nvidia's stock has surged around 1,800% in the last five
years. Magnificent Seven stocks on average more than tripled in
that time, while the benchmark S&P 500 has gained about 65%.

    By Jeanny Kao
       TAIPEI, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo
Jyh-huei said on Thursday that chipmaker TSMC <2330.TW> would
need government permission for any overseas joint ventures, but
there are no restrictions on making the most advanced chips
overseas other than for China.
    U.S. media have said Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co,
the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to
companies such as Apple <AAPL.O> and Nvidia <NVDA.O>, has been
in talks for a stake in Intel <INTC.O>.
    Neither company has confirmed the talks, but U.S. President
Donald Trump has criticised Taiwan for taking away American
semiconductor business and says he wants the industry back in
his country.
    Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Kuo said that ""no one can
shake the foundations"" of Taiwan's semiconductor industry.
    ""We have to have confidence in TSMC, and the government will
fully support the 'sacred mountain protecting the country,"" he
added, using an expression that refers both to the importance of
the chip sector and TSMC to Taiwan's economy.
    The government will not interfere in TSMC's decisions, Kuo
said.
    ""For TSMC to go into the world and have a joint venture in
any location, it definitely needs government permission,"" he
added.
    Large overseas investments need to be approved by Taiwan's
economy ministry, and Taiwan does not allow its companies to
produce the most advanced chips in China.
    Kuo said there is no change to these rules, but permission
must still be first obtained from the government for such
production in countries other than China. 
    TSMC is already in the process of investing $65 billion in
new factories in the U.S. state of Arizona, with Taiwan's
government giving permission for what is currently the most
advanced 2 nanometre chips to be made there, though not for a
couple of years.
    Taiwan, which runs a large trade surplus with the United
States, could also be subject to wide-ranging import tariffs
Trump has threatened to impose to deal with trade imbalances.
    Kuo said the ministry was collecting information for
government negotiators to talk to the Trump administration on
the tariffs issue to seek the best conditions for Taiwanese
companies, but he declined to comment on the contents of the
talks.

2025-02-26 19:09:52,UPDATE 1-US examining whether UK's encryption demand on Apple broke data treaty,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250226:nL2N3PH10C:3,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"(Adds quote from letter, background on Apple and encryption in
paragraphs 3-8; byline)
    By Stephen Nellis
       Feb 26 (Reuters) - 
    U.S. officials are examining whether the UK broke a
bilateral agreement by reportedly demanding that Apple <AAPL.O>
build a ""backdoor"" allowing the British government to access
backups of data in the company's encrypted cloud storage
systems.
  
        Apple last week 
    withdrew
     an encrypted storage feature for UK users, after reports
that it had refused to create such a backdoor allowing access to
messages and photos even for users outside the country. The
Washington Post 
    reported
     that Apple rejected such a demand by the British
government.
  
        In a letter dated February 25 to two U.S. lawmakers,
Tulsi Gabbard, the U.S. director of national intelligence, said
the U.S. is examining whether the UK government had violated the
CLOUD Act, which bars it from issuing demands for the data of
U.S. citizens and vice versa.
  
    ""My lawyers are working to provide a legal opinion on the
implications of the reported U.K. demands against Apple on the
bilateral CLOUD Act agreement,"" Gabbard wrote to U.S. Ron Wyden,
an Oregon Democrat, and Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican. 
        ""Upon initial review of the U.S. and U.K. bilateral
CLOUD Act Agreement, the United Kingdom may not issue demands
for data of U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent
residents (""U.S. persons""), nor is it authorized to demand the
data of persons located inside the United States.""
  
        In 2022, Apple introduced end-to-end encryption for
iCloud backups of its iPhones, meaning that only the user -
rather than Apple - has the keys to unscramble the data.
  
        
    Cybersecurity experts told Reuters
     that if Apple had chosen to build a backdoor for a
government, that backdoor would eventually be found and
exploited by hackers.
  
        Apple has sparred with regulators over encryption as far
back as 2016 when the U.S. government tried to compel it to
build a tool to unlock a terrorism suspect's iPhone.

       Feb 26 (Reuters) - 
    Since returning to office on January 20, U.S. President
Donald 
    Trump
     has initiated numerous tariffs threats. 
  
    They range from broad ones - a universal tariff on
foreign-imported goods - to ones aimed at specific sectors,
regions, or countries in an effort to get others to meet his
policy demands.
    Trump's threats have changed over time, leaving other
nations and businesses unclear of what is to come next.
    Here is a roundup of Trump's trade-related steps and
threats. 
     
    BROAD TARIFFS
        A cornerstone of Trump's vision includes a phased
rollout of universal tariffs on all U.S. imports.
        Earlier this month, Trump tasked his economics team with
devising plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country that
taxes U.S. imports, and to counteract non-tariff barriers such
as vehicle safety rules that exclude U.S. autos, and value-added
taxes that increase their cost.
    Whereas tariffs were once the mainstay of U.S. tax revenues,
in recent decades they have dwindled to a fraction of U.S. tax
receipts. Economists say Trump's policies will be inflationary
as importing businesses, which pay tariffs, will likely pass
added costs to consumers.
    Global trading partners could impose counter-tariffs,
targeting U.S. agricultural, energy, and machinery exports. This
could escalate into a worldwide trade war, creating uncertainty
for businesses and investors.
     
    SPECIFIC COUNTRIES
    Trump's tariff proposals target several key trade partners.
    
    MEXICO AND CANADA: The two countries were the largest trade
partners of the U.S. in 2024 through November, with Mexico
ranked first. Trump announced plans to impose duties on imports
from Mexico and Canada to go into effect Feb. 4 as retaliation
for migration and fentanyl trafficking. The proposed tariffs
included a 25% levy on most goods from Mexico and Canada, with a
10% tariff on energy imports from Canada.
        Just before those tariffs were imposed, however, Trump
paused them until March 4, pending negotiations with those two
nations. 
    Trump said on Monday that tariffs on Canadian and Mexican
imports are ""on time and on schedule"" despite efforts by the
countries to beef up border security and halt the flow of
fentanyl into the U.S. ahead of a March 4 deadline.
     Canada primarily exports crude oil and other energy goods
along with cars and car parts as part of the North American auto
manufacturing chain. Mexico exports various goods to the U.S. in
the industrial and auto sectors.
    
    CHINA: Trump imposed an additional 10% tariff across all
Chinese imports into the U.S., which came into effect on
February 4, after he repeatedly warned Beijing it was not doing
enough to halt the flow of illicit drugs into the United States.
        
  
    EUROPE: Trump said the EU and other countries have troubling
trade surpluses with the United States. He has said the
countries' products will either be subject to tariffs or he will
demand they buy more oil and gas from the U.S., even though U.S.
gas export capacity is near its limits.
        The European Commission said in a statement on February
14 that it viewed the ""reciprocal"" trade policy as a step in the
wrong direction. 
    
    RUSSIA: Trump has threatened to hit Russia ""and other
participating countries"" with taxes, tariffs and sanctions if a
deal to end the war in Ukraine is not struck soon.
    
    INDIA/BRICS NATIONS: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met
with Trump in Washington mid-February and offered to talk about
easing tariffs, buying more U.S. oil, gas and combat aircraft,
and potential concessions. 
        India imposes the highest tariffs on U.S. exports of any
major U.S. trading partner.
    Trump also threatened the broader BRICS group of nations
with tariffs if they did not commit to not create a new
currency. 
    
    COLOMBIA: Trump said he would put 25% tariffs on Colombian
goods after the country refused to take in flights carrying
migrants to be deported from the U.S.; the two sides worked out
an agreement.
     
    PRODUCTS
    METALS: On February 9, Trump said he was going to put
tariffs on imports of all steel and aluminum, used by
automakers, aerospace companies, and in construction and
infrastructure. 
    The U.S. is the world's largest aluminum importer, according
to World Bank data. It has had a trade deficit in steel for a
decade, according to the International Trade Administration. It
is the second largest steel importer worldwide, with more than
half of those volumes coming from Canada, Mexico and Brazil.
    Trump on Tuesday ordered a new probe into possible new
tariffs on copper imports to rebuild U.S. production of the
metal critical in electric vehicles, military hardware,
semiconductors and a wide range of consumer goods.
        The U.S. produces domestically just over half the
refined 
    copper
     it consumes each year.
  
    
    SEMICONDUCTORS: Trump said tariffs on semiconductor chips
would also start at ""25% or higher"", rising substantially over
the course of a year, but didn't clarify when these will come
into effect.
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co <2330.TW> the world's
largest contract chipmaker, makes semiconductors for Nvidia,
Apple and other U.S. clients, and generated 70% of its revenue
in 2024 from customers based in North America.
    
    PHARMACEUTICALS: Imposing 25% or higher tariffs on imported
pharmaceuticals could weigh on Japan, home of major drugmakers
such as Takeda, Astellas, Daiichi Sankyo and Eisai.
    India would also be impacted as most domestic generic
drugmakers count the U.S. as their largest market, with exports
to the country accounting for about 31% of the industry's
overall exports.
    
    AUTOMOBILES: Trump said levies on automobiles would come as
soon as April 2. The European Union, for instance, collects a
10% duty on vehicle imports, four times the U.S. passenger car
tariff rate of 2.5%. However, the U.S. currently collects a 25%
tariff on pickup trucks from countries other than Mexico and
Canada. 
    Trump had also floated the idea of 100% or greater tariffs
on other vehicles, including potentially EVs. The automobile
industry accounted for imports of more than $202 billion from
Canada and Mexico combined in 2024.

       WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald
Trump on Wednesday urged Apple <AAPL.O> to scrap its diversity,
equity and inclusion policies, a day after the iPhone maker's
shareholders voted overwhelmingly to keep them in the face of
growing pushback from conservative groups.
    Big U.S. companies, including Meta <META.O> and Alphabet
<GOOGL.O>, have dropped DEI initiatives as Trump's returned to
the presidency. 
    He has called them discriminatory and suggested the
Department of Justice could investigate if such efforts violate
the law.
    ""Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make
adjustments to them. DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for
our country. DEI is gone!!!"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth
Social that was in uppercase.
    Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    Tuesday's vote at the iPhone maker's annual meeting was seen
as a test of shareholder views on DEI programs, which many
companies added or beefed up starting in 2020 amid the Black
Lives Matter movement. 
    Supporters of the policies say they address longstanding
bias, inequity and discrimination. But proponents of the
proposal against Apple's DEI had argued recent legal changes
could result in an increase in discrimination cases if Apple
continued such policies. 
    Trump issued an executive order in January to end DEI
initiatives in the federal government and private sector, saying
such efforts discriminates against other Americans, including
white people and men and weakens the importance of merit in job
hiring or promotion. 
    Apple has said it had an active oversight effort to avoid
legal risks and that the proposal inappropriately restricted
management.
    The company reports workforce diversity data but sets no
targets or quotas, focusing its DEI efforts on programs such as
a racial justice initiative that supports historically Black
colleges and universities in the U.S. 
    Apple's  ""strength has always come from hiring the very best
people and then providing a culture of collaboration, one where
people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives come together
to innovate"", CEO Tim Cook said at Tuesday's meeting.
    But he also signaled the company may make some adjustments
in response to new developments. 
    ""As the legal landscape around these issues evolves, we may
need to make some changes to comply, but our North Star of
dignity and respect for everyone and our work to that end will
never waver,"" Cook said.

    By Stanley Widianto
       JAKARTA, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Apple <AAPL.O> should be
able to sell its iPhone 16 phones in Indonesia soon, its
industry minister said on Wednesday, after both sides agreed
deals including an Apple manufacturing plant and a research and
development centre. 
This agreement signals an end to tenuous negotiations between
Apple and Indonesia, which last year banned sales of the iPhone
16 due to Apple's failure to meet requirements on locally-made
components.  
    Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita said the months-long
negotiations with Apple had been ""tricky"", but the firm was now
in the process of obtaining a local content certificate to sell
its handsets.  
    ""There's a principle of justness that we're trying to
uphold,"" Agus told a press conference. ""As much as it can add
value to the red and white,"" he said, referring to the national
flag.  
    Analysts have said the local content rules could hurt
investor confidence and trigger protectionism concerns. 
    As part of the agreements with Apple worth more than $300
million, the firm will invest in a software research and
development centre near the capital Jakarta, plus plants to
produce components for its products, including its AirPods
headphones, Agus said.
    Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for
comment on the agreements. News website CNN Indonesia quoted an
Apple representative on Wednesday as saying it was happy to
expand its investment in the country and offer all its products
to consumers. 
    Apple has no manufacturing facilities in Indonesia, a
country of about 280 million people, but since 2018 it has set
up local developer academies.
    Companies can usually meet Indonesia's composition
requirements through local partnerships or by sourcing parts
locally. 
    Agus gave no timeframe for when Apple would get the green
light to sell its iPhone 16 in Indonesia.
    Apple was outside the top five smartphone brands in the
third quarter of last year, according research firm Canalys.

    By Faith Hung and Jeanny Kao
       TAIPEI, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Taiwan's trade-reliant
economy is expected to grow at a slower pace in 2025 than
previously forecast, with the threat of turbulence from tariffs
that may be imposed by the United States, as well as
parliament-imposed budget cuts.   
    Taiwan is a key link in the global technology supply chain
for companies such as Apple Inc <AAPL.O> and Nvidia <NVDA.O>,
and is home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) <2330.TW> <TSM.N>.
    U.S. President Donald Trump has floated a proposal for a
minimum 25% tariff on chips. Taiwan has responded to the tariff
threat with diplomatic overtures and plans to discuss chip
investment in the United States.   
    The United States is Taiwan's second-biggest export
destination after China.
    The Trump administration has announced wide-ranging tariffs
""affecting global trade momentum and pushing up inflationary
pressure, and intensifying economic uncertainties,"" the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said in
a statement on Wednesday.
    Taiwan could feel the pinch as its exports become affected
by potential tariffs from the third or the fourth quarter, the
statistics agency added.  
    Taiwan's gross domestic product for this year is now
expected to be 3.14% higher than last year, the agency said, 
revising down the 3.29% forecast it issued in November.
    That would be lower than the 4.59% growth rate for 2024.
    The agency said budget cuts imposed by Taiwan's
opposition-dominated parliament would also reduce economic
growth this year given it would mean less government investment
and spending.
    However, exports this year were expected to grow 7.08%, the
agency said, upgrading a previous forecast of 5.98%.
    The statistics agency nudged up the 2025 consumer price
index (CPI) forecast to 1.94% from 1.93%.
    The economy expanded by 2.9% in the fourth quarter from a
year earlier, it said, revising upwards a preliminary 1.84%
reading.

 (Adds vote totals and details)
    By Stephen Nellis
       Feb 25 (Reuters) - Apple <AAPL.O> shareholders voted to
keep the tech giant's diversity, equity and inclusion policies
on Tuesday, a win for management which had opposed efforts by a
conservative group to scrap the program.
    The vote at the iPhone maker's annual meeting was seen as a
test of shareholder views about the value of DEI programs, which
many companies added or beefed up starting in 2020 amid the
Black Lives Matter movement. 
    A growing conservative backlash has pushed major U.S.
companies, including Meta <META.O> and Alphabet <GOOGL.O>, to
drop DEI initiatives ahead of and following Donald Trump's
return to the U.S. presidency. 
    Trump has criticized corporate DEI programs as
discriminatory and suggested the U.S. Department of Justice
could investigate whether such efforts violate the law.
    The National Center for Public Policy Research, which
describes itself as a free-market think-tank, had submitted the
proposal titled ""Request to Cease DEI Efforts"" to the
shareholder meeting. The proposal was defeated, with 210.45
million votes for it and 8.84 billion votes against it.
    Proponents of the proposal argued that recent legal changes
meant Apple would see an increase in discrimination cases if it
continued DEI policies. Apple said it had an active oversight
effort to avoid legal risks and that the proposal
inappropriately restricted management.
    While Apple discloses diversity data about its employee
base, the company did not set targets or quotas. Many of its DEI
efforts are in the form of programs such as a racial justice
initiative under which it has provided support to historically
Black colleges and universities in the U.S.
    Apple also carries out DEI efforts outside of the U.S., such
support for teaching coding skills to indigenous populations in
Mexico and working with an Aboriginal community–led nonprofit
pursuing criminal justice reform in Australia.
    Apple shareholders have in the past rejected proposals that
would have required the company to disclose more about racial
and gender pay gaps.
    Apple CEO Tim Cook said at Tuesday's meeting the company's
""strength has always come from hiring the very best people and
then providing a culture of collaboration, one where people with
diverse backgrounds and perspectives come together to innovate.""
    But Cook added that ""as the legal landscape around these
issues evolves, we may need to make some changes to comply, but
our North Star of dignity and respect for everyone and our work
to that end will never waver.""
    The same group had asked Costco Wholesale to report on the
risks of maintaining its DEI initiatives. The membership-only
retailer's shareholders voted strongly against the proposal at a
meeting in January.    
    On Monday, Apple highlighted its spending in the United
States, saying it planned $500 billion in investments in the
next four years, drawing praise from Trump days after media
reported that Cook had met with the president.
    Apple shareholders also voted against a proposal asking the
company to prepare a report assessing the risks of its work with
AI, though the proposal got the most votes of any shareholder
effort. It received 1.04 billion ""for"" votes and 7.96 billion
""against"" votes.
    All Apple management proposals, including a ""say on pay""
provision, were approved.
    Cook said on Tuesday that Apple would be the biggest
customer of a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co <2330.TW>
factory in Arizona that Trump helped bring to the United States
during his first term.

    By David Lawder and Andrea Shalal
       WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump
opened yet another front on Tuesday in his assault on global
trade norms, ordering a probe into potential new tariffs on
copper imports to rebuild U.S. production of a metal critical to
electric vehicles, military hardware, the power grid and many
consumer goods.
    Trump, looking to thwart what his advisers see as a move by
China to dominate the global copper market, signed an order at
the White House directing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to
start a national security probe under Section 232 of the Trade
Expansion Act of 1962. That is the same law Trump used in his
first term to impose 25% global tariffs on steel and aluminum.
    A White House official, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, said any potential tariff rate would be determined by
the investigation, adding that Trump preferred tariffs over
quotas.
    The move is the latest by Trump to upend decades of business
support for free trade that he railed against as both candidate
and president for hollowing out the U.S. industrial base, an
upheaval now aimed at long-time U.S. allies like Canada and
Mexico as well geopolitical adversaries like China.
        He has issued a cascade of tariff orders since taking up
residency in the White House for a second term last month. While
only a new 10% levy on all imports from China is in place,
25%duties on goods from Canada and Mexico are set to take effect
next week and others aimed at steel, aluminum and motor vehicles
will follow shortly afterward or are in fast-track development.
    Trump's blitz has begun to take a toll on consumer
confidence, which had initially surged following his election
victory in November over former President Joe Biden as Trump
promised to bring down living costs. Earlier on Tuesday the
Conference Board reported the largest drop in consumer
confidence in three-and-a-half years, with households expecting
a resurgence in inflation.
    Ahead of the copper announcement, stocks fell on Wall Street
for a fourth straight day, a drop pinned on growing uncertainty
about Trump policies on trade in particular.
    But there were pockets of upside among perceived winners:
Shares of the world's largest copper producer, Phoenix-based
Freeport-McMoran <FCX.N> shot up 5% in after-hours trading. The
company, which produced 1.26 billions of copper in the U.S. last
year, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    London-based Antofagasta <ANTO.L> declined to comment on
Trump's action. The company is trying to develop the $1.7
billion Twin Metals copper and nickel mine in Minnesota, but saw
its mineral rights blocked under former president Biden's
administration over water pollution concerns.
    Trump has vowed to ease regulations on businesses to boost
U.S. economic growth.
        
  
        TARGETING CHINA    
    White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the
investigation would be completed quickly, ""in Trump time.""
    Navarro said China was using state subsidies and excess
capacity to undermine competition and gain control over global
copper production, in much the same way it now dominates steel
and aluminum production.  
    That said, the countries set to be most affected by any new
U.S. copper tariffs would be Chile, Canada and Mexico, which
were the top suppliers of refined copper, copper alloys and
copper articles in 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. 
       
     
     ""Like our steel and aluminum industries, our great American
copper industry has been decimated by global actors attacking
our domestic production,"" Lutnick said during the White House
signing session, vowing to end unfair trade practices that have
put Americans out of work.
     ""American industries depend on copper, and it should be
made in America, no exemptions, no exceptions,"" he said. ""It's
time for copper to come home."" 
    A White House fact sheet said the investigation would assess
the national security risks from growing U.S. dependence on
imported copper ""in all its forms,"" citing data showing the U.S.
depended on imports for 45% of its copper consumption last year,
up sharply from the early 1990s.
        The White House official said the investigation, which
also includes the U.S. Trade Representative's office, would look
at imports of raw mined copper, copper concentrates, copper
alloy, scrap copper and derivative products made from the metal.
The official declined to identify any specific derivatives,
saying that would prejudge the investigation.
    The official said the Department of Energy recognized copper
as a critical material in the medium term due to increased
demand for solar energy technologies and global electrification,
noting that it was the second most widely used material in U.S.
weapons platforms.
    
    MORE CAPACITY NEEDED 
    The official said based on current demand for electric
vehicles and power-hungry artificial intelligence applications,
there will be a U.S. copper shortage in the future, and the
United States cannot develop adequate copper smelting and
refining capacity unless there is a reasonable certainty of
long-lasting trade protection for the sector.
    During Tuesday's signing, Lutnick also said the Trump
administration would hold countries accountable for imposing
digital services taxes on U.S. technology firms including
Google, Apple and Amazon. Trump on Friday ordered USTR to revive
tariff investigations into these taxes.
        ""Both friend and foe have been treating American tech
companies, partially, as if our companies are their piggy bank,""
Lutnick said. ""This will now end. It is my objective to level
the playing field and end these attacks.""

2025-02-25 19:29:05,Dassault Systèmes partners with Apple to put industrial 3D software on Vision Pro,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250225:nL2N3PG0XN:5,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"By Stephen Nellis
       Feb 25 (Reuters) - Dassault Systèmes <DAST.PA> on
Tuesday said that it has worked with Apple <AAPL.O> to integrate
Apple's Vision Pro into its 3D software, which is widely used in
manufacturing, life sciences and urban planning.
    France-based Dassault Systèmes has hundreds of thousands of
customers who use its software to design cars, airplanes and
factories, according to the company. It creates what are known
as ""digital twins"" of real-world objects and places, recreating
them with a high enough degree of accuracy that designers and
engineers can make changes to the digital version and be
confident that those changes will work in the real world.
    Dassault Systèmes said that starting this summer, the
company will release an app called ""3DLive"" that will allow
engineers and designers to collaborate on a 3D model in real
time and remotely.
    Tom Acland, chief executive of the firm's 3DEXCITE unit,
said possible real-world uses could be helping find potential
problems in accessing manufacturing machines for maintenance
long before they are installed on a factory floor, after which
rearranging them could be far more expensive.
    ""Those things tend to only get discovered very late in the
process,"" Acland told Reuters. ""But if you could allow the
maintenance engineer to walk into the line of equipment before
it arrives, they can start to design those maintenance
procedures before the equipment ever arrives.""
    Dassault Systèmes' app will require deep collaboration with
Apple because it represents 3D models with the level of
scientific accuracy required by tapping into the Vision Pro's
sensors and computing power, which comes from the same chips
used in Apple's Mac computers. Hashing out problems with, for
example, aircraft designs requires more accuracy than other apps
like video games.
    ""It's not just a gimmick - it's actually a very powerful
tool for engineers and designers to make decisions,"" Mike
Rockwell, vice president of Apple's vision products group, told
Reuters. ""You're able to make these decisions earlier in the
process, and that can save you huge amounts of money and time
and rework.""

    By Alden Bentley and Amanda Cooper
       NEW YORK/LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - U.S. indexes bucked
steady global equity markets overnight and Treasury yields fell
to 2-1/2 month lows, trading off signs of  softening U.S. growth
and uncertainty over Trump administration policies while
Germany's election result was buoying the euro.
    Nervousness about Nvidia's fourth quarter results after the
market close on Wednesday hung over the market. Friday's
Personal Consumption Expenditures price index release, which the
Federal Reserve tracks for its mandate to control inflation, was
also in focus.
    Investors were briefly rattled by an order from U.S.
President Donald Trump to limit Chinese investments in strategic
U.S. sectors such as chips, AI and aerospace.
    A weak read on U.S. consumer confidence added to the
negative mood, with the S&P 500 <.SPX > last down 0.73%, while
the yield on the benchmark 10-year yield fell below 4.30% to its
lowest since December 12.
    ""Bearish growth sentiment – from last Friday’s weak PMIs,
perhaps, or geopolitical jitters – is bound to linger until
something substantive convinces investors otherwise,"" FHN
Financial macro strategist Will Campernolle said in a note on
Tuesday. He added that Treasury coupon auctions on Tuesday and
Wednesday could test the durability of the rally, at least until
the release of Friday’s January PCE inflation report.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was off 0.15% and
the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> fell 1.43% in early trade.
    The 10-year yield <US10YT=RR> was down 9.5 basis points at
4.298% while the 2-year note <US2YT=RR> yield, which typically
moves in step with interest rate expectations for the Fed, fell
7.8 basis points to 4.09%, hitting its lowest since December 6. 
    In Europe, the STOXX 600 <.STOXX> rose 0.9%, while the euro
<EUR=EBS> was up 0.45% at $1.0513 near the one-month high
reached on Monday after Friedrich Merz's opposition
conservatives won Germany's national election.
    The dollar index <=USD>, which measures the greenback
against a basket of currencies dominated by the euro and yen,
was off about half a percent.    
    The euro is up around 1% so far this year, but is still one
of the worst-performing major currencies against the dollar,
given its high exposure to the risk of tariffs.
    Trump's planned duties on U.S. imports risk pushing up
domestic inflation, while his mass firings of government
employees could impact the labour market, just when the Federal
Reserve needs room to cut interest rates.
    Tension between the U.S. and Europe has also risen over
Ukraine and how to broker a ceasefire agreement with Russia,
three years after Moscow's full-blown invasion of its neighbour.
    Sentiment in the markets is fragile but there has been
little in the way of volatility, according to Chris Beauchamp,
chief strategist at IG.
    ""This is a sharp contrast to the past couple of years where
crises seem to come one at a time and then, you could just deal
with them when they occurred, and now it seems to be
'everything, everywhere, all at once',"" he said.
    
    REASONS FOR OPTIMISM?
    CBOE's VIX volatility index rose to its highest in a month
on Tuesday, but so far has fallen short of the peak from late
January. 
    Beauchamp said there are reasons to be optimistic. 
    ""If you look at earnings season, it's gone really well. But
of course, the headlines and the signs of fracture between
Europe and the U.S. - it doesn't directly affect ... stocks, but
it just makes sentiment all the more febrile."" 
    Meanwhile, negative surprises in U.S. economic data have
accelerated this month, led by unwelcome pickups in things like
consumer inflation expectations and, most recently, by a drop in
overall business activity.
    The futures market shows traders expect the Fed to cut rates
by around 50 basis points this year, up from 40 bps a week ago.
<0#USDIRPR> 
    Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argued on Tuesday  that the
U.S. economy is more fragile under the surface than economic
metrics suggest, citing interest rate volatility, sticky
inflation and job growth focused on the government sector.
    Since China's low-cost AI model from DeepSeek burst onto the
scene in late January, investors have begun to question whether
the hefty spending on this technology is justified and a lot
will be riding on Nvidia's fourth-quarter earnings.
    Having pushed stocks on both sides of the Atlantic to record
highs this month, investors are getting uneasy about results
from Nvidia, which has come to characterise the boom in
artificial intelligence investment and could prove instrumental
in setting the mood for the remainder of the quarter.
   Chinese retail investors have poured into AI-linked stocks on
the domestic market this month, sending the Hong Kong equity
index <.HIS> to three-year highs.
    A Bloomberg report overnight that Washington is seeking to
toughen restrictions on the export of semiconductor technology
to China, with the help of allies, sent shares in tech giant
Alibaba <9988.HK> down 3%.
    Trump also indicated overnight that proposed tariffs on
Mexico and Canada were still set to start next week, which
nudged the U.S. dollar up marginally against its Canadian
counterpart <CAD=EBS>.
    In commodities, Brent crude futures <LCOc1> fell 1.7% to
$73.54 a barrel, U.S. crude <CLc1> fell 1.77% to $69.46, while
gold <XAU=> fell 0.8% to $2,930 an ounce, having hit a record
high of $2,956.15 on Monday.
    Bitcoin <BTC=> ran into some profit-taking, falling by as
more than 7% to below $87,000, as traders continued to process
last week's hack of $1.5 billion worth of ether from
cryptoexchange Bybit.

       Feb 25 (Reuters) - Adobe <ADBE.O> said on Tuesday it is
bringing its Photoshop app to mobile phones for the first time,
offering both a free version and a paid version at the lowest
cost yet for the app, at $7.99 per month.
    First released in 1990, Adobe's digital image software is
enough of a household name to have become a verb for touching up
photos. But it has always cost money, and the lowest-cost
version previously was a $9.99 per month subscription for
Apple's <AAPL.O> iPad.
    Adobe has now released a free version for Apple's iPhone,
with an Android app coming soon, Adobe executives told Reuters.
Adobe will offer a premium version for $7.99 a month that
includes more features as well as access to more cloud storage
and the web-based version of Photoshop for editing on larger
screens.
    The move comes as mobile operating systems from Apple and
Alphabet's <GOOGL.O> Google have replicated, for free, many
longtime Photoshop features such as adjusting a photo's colors
or removing some distracting objects.
    Adobe's software for creative professionals still makes up
more than half of its sales at a time when the company in
December gave a 2025 revenue forecast that missed Wall Street
expectations.
    Deepa Subramaniam, Adobe's vice president of product
marketing for creative professional apps, said the company is
focused on courting younger users whose phones are their primary
camera and editing device when they need more tools than a
phone's operating system offers. 
    Even the free version of the Photoshop app will have
features such as splitting a photo into separate layers, masking
off parts of it and adding text - all of which can be used to
create cover shots for podcasts, streaming music playlists or
YouTube videos.
    ""We spent a lot of time and energy testing directly with our
target user base, which is the next-generation creator who does
a lot on their phone. It is the way that they express personal
creativity, and the application is really built for them,""
Subramaniam told Reuters.

softening in the U.S. economy ahead of earnings from Nvidia

2025-02-25 13:00:00,RPT-BREAKINGVIEWS-Apple’s $500 bln reveal has iPhone-like ring to it,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250225:nL3N3PF1CQ:1,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.  The opinions
expressed are his own.)
    By Robert Cyran
       NEW YORK, Feb 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple
<AAPL.O> has mastered the art of hyping the ho-hum. The iPhone
maker’s semi-regular product presentations carry on a mystique
created by late founder Steve Jobs, even when the updates are
rather ordinary. Boss Tim Cook is borrowing the approach for his
latest $500 billion reveal.
    The figure, unveiled on Monday, represents the amount Apple
intends to spend in the United States over the next four years.
It includes everything from hiring 20,000 workers to building a
server factory in Houston to funding blockbuster films for its
streaming service. Half a trillion dollars sprinkled around the
country is also the sort of commitment that can buy some
goodwill with President Donald Trump.
    Many such announcements tend to be flimsy or ephemeral.
Foxconn’s plan to build a $10 billion plant and create 13,000
jobs in Wisconsin, rolled out in 2017 after Trump first took
office, is the archetype of the genre. The Taiwanese
manufacturer later dramatically scaled back the project. A
promised $500 billion artificial intelligence initiative from
OpenAI, SoftBank <9984.T> and Oracle <ORCL.N> has the potential
to go the same way. Apple’s blueprint, is more plausible.
    In 2021, it said it would allocate $430 billion to the U.S.
over five years and is on track to do so. On that basis, Apple
has gone from earmarking about $85 billion a year to about $125
billion, or increase domestic spending about 10% annually. The
rate is roughly the same as recent growth for operating costs
and investment, with a bit more thrown in to bring some
production home.
    Although it would be a healthy outlay, it pales compared to
some other technology splurges. For example, Microsoft's
<MSFT.O> capital expenditure alone over roughly the next four
years is expected to be some $400 billion, according to Visible
Alpha, more than twice as much as during the previous four.
Similarly, Apple’s latest hiring pledge is the same as the ones
it made in both 2018 and 2021.
    Why make such a big deal of what’s mostly business as usual?
For one thing, Apple is more vulnerable than peers to
intensifying trade wars. About 15% of its nearly $400 billion in
revenue in the year to September 28 came from China, which is
also a big manufacturing hub for its devices. Higher tariffs
probably would mean higher U.S. prices for its gadgets, while
any retaliation would threaten sales in China. Although Apple’s
financial update is largely incremental, creating a little buzz,
in the White House at least, may yet generate some substance.
    Follow @rob_cyran on X
         
    CONTEXT NEWS 
    Apple said on February 24 that it would spend more than $500
billion in the United States over the next four years and hire
at least 20,000 people, mostly to work in research, software
development and artificial intelligence.
    The spending commitment includes payments to suppliers,
direct employment, Apple data centers, corporate facilities and
Apple TV+ production. It also earmarks $5 billion for its U.S.
manufacturing fund, which will double its size.
    As part of the package, Apple said it would be working with
partners to open a 250,000-square-foot facility to assemble
servers in Houston in 2026.

    By Amanda Cooper
       LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Global shares traded
cautiously higher on Tuesday, in light of growing evidence of a
softening in the U.S. economy ahead of earnings from Nvidia
<NVDA.O>, while the euro eased below the one-month highs that
followed Germany's weekend election.
    Investors were rattled early on by an order from U.S.
President Donald Trump to limit Chinese investments in strategic
areas such as chips, AI and aerospace.
    Having pushed stocks on both sides of the Atlantic to record
highs this month, investors are getting uneasy and Wednesday's
results from Nvidia, which has come to characterise the boom in
artificial intelligence investment, could prove instrumental in
setting the mood for the remainder of the quarter.
    In Europe, the STOXX 600 <.STOXX> rose 0.2%, while the euro
<EUR=EBS> steadied around $1.047, having topped $1.05 for the
first time in a month on Monday, after Friedrich Merz's
opposition conservatives won Germany's national election.     
    The euro is up around 1% so far this year, but is still one
of the worst-performing major currencies against the dollar,
given its high exposure to the risk of tariffs.
    Trump's planned duties on U.S. imports risk pushing up
domestic inflation, while his mass firings of government
employees could impact the labour market, just when the Federal
Reserve needs room to cut interest rates.
    Tension between the United States and Europe has also risen
over Ukraine and how to broker a ceasefire agreement with
Russia.
    Sentiment in the markets is fragile, but there has not been
much in the way of volatility, Chris Beauchamp, chief strategist
at IG, said.    
    ""This is a sharp contrast to the past couple of years where
crises seem to come one at a time and then, you could just deal
with them when they occurred, and now it seems to be
'everything, everywhere, all at once',"" he said.
    ""There are reasons to be optimistic, I think. If you look at
earnings season, it's gone really well. But of course, the
headlines and the signs of fracture between Europe and the U.S.
- it doesn't directly affect ... stocks, but it just makes
sentiment all the more febrile."" 
    
    NOT SO EXCEPTIONAL     
    Meanwhile, negative surprises in U.S. economic data have
accelerated this month, led by unwelcome pickups in things like
consumer inflation expectations and, most recently, by a drop in
overall business activity.
    The futures market shows traders expect the Fed to cut rates
by around 50 basis points this year, up from 40 bps a week ago.
<0#USDIRPR> 
    U.S. stock futures pared earlier losses on Tuesday to trade
unchanged on the day <ESc1> <NQc1>, indicating a steadier start
later on Wall Street, where technology stocks tumbled overnight.
    Since China's low-cost AI model from DeepSeek burst onto the
scene in late January, investors have started to question
whether the hefty spending on this technology is justified and a
lot will be riding on Nvidia's fourth-quarter earnings.
    Chinese retail investors have poured into AI-linked stocks
on the domestic market this month, sending the Hong Kong equity
index <.HIS> to three-year highs.
    A Bloomberg report overnight that Washington is seeking to
toughen restrictions on the export of semiconductor technology
to China, with the help of allies, sent shares in tech giant
Alibaba <9988.HK> down 3%.
    ""The optimism about China's tech sector cools off as markets
realise that the more positive the outlook for the sector, the
greater the risk it will be targeted by the U.S.,"" said Kyle
Rodda, a senior analyst at Capital.com. 
    Trump also indicated overnight that proposed tariffs on
Mexico and Canada were still set to start next week, which
nudged the U.S. dollar up marginally against its Canadian
counterpart <CAD=EBS>.
    Yields on the 10-year Treasury note <US10YT=RR> fell 5 basis
points to 4.346%, around their lowest for two months.
    In commodities, Brent crude futures <LCOc1> edged up 0.1% to
$74.85 a barrel, following fresh U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran,
while gold <XAU=> fell 0.4% to $2,940 an ounce, having hit a
record high of $2,956.15 on Monday.
    Bitcoin <BTC=> ran into some profit-taking, falling by as
much as 6% to below $89,000, as traders continued to process
last week's hack of $1.5 billion worth of ether from
cryptoexchange Bybit.

       Feb 25 (Reuters) - Indonesia and Apple <AAPL.O> have
agreed on terms to lift the country's ban on iPhone 16s and
could sign a deal as early as this week, Bloomberg News reported
on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.
    Indonesia banned the iPhone 16 in October after Apple failed
to meet requirements that smartphones sold domestically should
comprise at least 35% locally-made parts.
    Since then, Indonesia's investment minister has said Apple
plans to invest $1 billion in a manufacturing plant that
produces components for smartphones and other products.
    Besides this investment, Apple will commit to training
locals in research and development on its products and this will
be done through programs other than existing Apple academies,
the report said.
    However, Apple has no immediate plans to start making
iPhones in the country, the report said.
    Apple and Indonesia's Ministry for Industry, which was
tasked with enforcing the ban, did not immediately respond to
Reuters' requests for comment. They did not respond to Bloomberg
either.

 (Updates price indicators for European markets)
    By Stella Qiu
       SYDNEY, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Asian shares slid on Tuesday
amid concerns about U.S. investment curbs on China, while a
run-up in the euro faded as investors wait for Germany to sort
out the formation of its new government.
        Investors are also cautious ahead of results from
artificial intelligence darling Nvidia <NVDA.O> on Wednesday,
where options point to a share price move of about 8% in either
direction should they surprise. 
        Europe is set to open flat, with pan-European STOXX 50
futures <STXEc1> little changed. Nasdaq futures <NQc1> and S&P
500 futures <ESc1> were up 0.1% in Asia. 
        In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares
outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> dropped 1%. Japan's Nikkei <.N225>
returned from a public holiday with a 1.3% fall, but shares of
its five major trading houses surged thanks to interest from
billionaire investor Warren Buffett.
    Bank of Korea on Tuesday cut its interest rates by a
quarter-point as expected, helping South Korean shares <.KS11>
to trim some losses. 
    Hong Kong's Hang Seng index <.HSI> initially fell as much as
2.7%, but it was last down 1%. Chinese blue chips <.CSI300>
dropped 0.8%. 
        Shares in tech giant Alibaba <9988.HK>, which had
propelled the Hong Kong index to three-year highs, were last
down 3.2% after its U.S.-listed shares tumbled 10% overnight in
the biggest daily drop in more than two years. 
    Investors were rattled by an order from U.S. President
Donald Trump to restrict Chinese investments in strategic areas
such as chips, AI and aerospace. Bloomberg reported Washington
is seeking to toughen restrictions on the export of
semiconductor technology to China, with the help of allies.
        ""The optimism about China's tech sector cools off as
markets realise that the more positive the outlook for the
sector, the greater the risk it will be targeted by the US,""
said Kyle Rodda, a senior analyst at Capital.com. 
    Also weighing on sentiment was Trump's indication that
proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada were still set to start
next week, although investors had hoped negotiations would
forestall the threat.
        Overnight on Wall Street, technology shares tumbled. The
broad pullback in stocks has raised the stakes for Nvidia's
results, when investors will be looking for further rapid growth
in revenue and questioning whether the hefty spending on the
technology is justified after China's low-cost DeepSeek rattled
the industry.
        A slew of weak U.S. data over recent days - including
retail sales, consumer confidence and surveys on the
manufacturing and services sectors - have eroded market
confidence about the exceptionalism of the U.S. economy, taking
some shine out of the U.S. dollar.  
    Combined with Trump's incoming tariffs and the uncertainty
over a barrage of federal government layoffs, investors see the
Federal Reserve on track to cut rates by a total of 50 basis
points this year, up from 40 bps just last week. 
    Bonds have rallied, with benchmark 10-year Treasury yields
<US10YT=RR> hitting a new two-month low of 4.371% in Asia.
Two-year yields <US2YT=RR> also touched 4.143%, the lowest since
early December.[US/]
        In currency markets, the run-up in the euro faded out,
with the currency back to where it started the week. It
<EUR=EBS> was last at $1.0476, having hit a one-month top of
$1.0528 after Germany's election produced no nasty surprises.
    The U.S. dollar bounced from its 2-1/2-month low against its
major peers and was last at 106.59 <=USD>. 
        Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany's next
chancellor after his opposition conservatives won the national
election. Merz should be able to form a coalition to govern with
the ruling centre-left Social Democrats, even though the party
finished third behind the far-right Alternative for Germany.
    Oil prices were slightly higher on Tuesday on fresh U.S.
sanctions imposed on Iran. Brent crude <LCOc1> rose 0.5% at
$75.13 a barrel, while U.S. crude <CLc1> was up 0.6% at $71.14 a
barrel. <O/R>
    Gold <XAU=> ran into some profit-taking and was last down
0.5% at $2,937 per ounce, having hit a record high of $2,956.15
on Monday.

U.S.-listed shares tumbled 10% overnight in the biggest daily

    ""The key aspect will then be how China/Asia-based traders
act after the initial weakness on the cash equity open, and
whether further sellers kick in feeling the momentum move is
firmly over,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at
Pepperstone. ""By way of event risk, there is little in the way
of data to trouble those trading intraday through Asia, and
cross-asset moves will be driven by portfolio flows in reaction
to Trump's directive and how China AI plays fare.""

       TAIPEI, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Taiwan's economy minister
said on Tuesday his ministry had not received information about
an overseas investment application by Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC
<2330.TW>, when asked about possible investment in Intel
<INTC.O> and the United States.
    U.S. media has reported that Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a
major supplier to companies including Apple <AAPL.O> and Nvidia
<NVDA.O>, has been in talks to potentially take a stake in
Intel.
    Neither TSMC nor Intel has confirmed the reports.
    Any large overseas investment by a Taiwanese company needs
government approval, specifically from the economy ministry's
investment review commission.  
    Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Economy Minister Kuo
Jyh-huei said he could not comment on market rumours, and the
ministry would only have ""certain discussions"" if it received an
official ""report"" from TSMC.
    ""Because it involves foreign investment it would go through
our investment commission. So far we have not received any
information, so I have no way to comment on this issue,"" Kuo
said.
    U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticised
Taiwan, saying it has taken away American semiconductor business
and that he wants manufacturing to return to the United States. 
    Trump has threatened to put tariffs both on semiconductor
imports and countries with which the United States has a large
trade imbalance.
    Taiwan runs a large trade surplus with the United States.
    Earlier this month, one of the economy ministry's deputy
ministers, Cynthia Kiang, visited the United States for talks.
    Kuo said that trip was to ""collect information"" and talk
with current and former U.S. officials.

    By Jonathan Stempel
       Feb 24 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway <BRKa.N> shares
rose to a record on Monday after the conglomerate run by Warren
Buffett posted its highest-ever quarterly profit, driven by
improvement in insurance operations.
    The conglomerate's Class A shares closed up $28,735.49, or
4%, at $747,485.49, after earlier reaching $755,968.
        Those levels surpassed even the $741,971 recorded by
some stock price services last June 3, following a trading
glitch.
    Berkshire's more widely held Class B shares closed up
$19.68, or 4.1%, at $498.42, The Omaha, Nebraska-based
conglomerate's market value rose to $1.08 trillion.
    Multiple analysts raised their price targets and earnings
forecasts. Buffett's own fortune increased to $155.5 billion,
ranking sixth worldwide, according to Forbes magazine.
    Berkshire on Saturday said fourth-quarter profit from its
189 operating businesses rose 71% to $14.53 billion, and
excluding currency gains totaled $13.38 billion, exceeding
analyst forecasts.
    Full-year operating profit rose 27% to $47.44 billion, also
a record.
    That was also helped by more income from $334.2 billion of
cash and equivalents, invested mainly in U.S. Treasury bills.
    Cash doubled in 2024 as Berkshire reduced its stake in Apple
<AAPL.O>, still its largest common stock holding. Net income,
including gains and losses from stocks, totaled $89 billion.
    In his annual shareholder letter, Buffett said Berkshire
outpaced his expectations, and singled out Geico Chief Executive
Todd Combs for improving the car insurer's underwriting while
cutting costs.
    Geico underwriting profit more than doubled in 2024 even as
it shed more than 2,300 jobs, in addition to 7,700 in 2023.
    UBS analyst Brian Meredith and KBW analyst Meyer Shields
raised their 2025 outlooks for Berkshire, with Meredith saying
Geico ""appears to have firmly turned the corner.""
    Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan called the cash stake
noteworthy in light of Buffett's comment that Berkshire paid
$26.8 billion, or more than $3 million an hour, in federal taxes
last year. Buffett cautioned Washington to spend it ""wisely.""
    Berkshire's operations also include railroad, energy,
industrial, retail and service businesses.
    Buffett, 94, has led Berkshire since 1965.
    He wrote that ""at 94, it won't be long before Greg Abel
replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters.""
Abel, 62, is a Berkshire vice chairman.

 (Updates with closing details)
    By Sinéad Carew and Johann M Cherian
       Feb 24 (Reuters) - 
    The Nasdaq Composite fell more than 1% on Monday, with big
technology stocks creating the biggest drag as investors worried
about demand for technology supporting artificial intelligence
while they waited for results from market heavyweight Nvidia.
  
        The S&P 500 closed slightly lower, marking its third
straight day of declines, while the Dow managed to eke out a
tiny gain. It was also Nasdaq's third consecutive loss and its
fourth daily drop of more than 1% so far in February. 
  
    Investors were concerned about future demand for Nvidia's
<NVDA.O> pricey AI chips as they awaited its quarterly results
on Wednesday. Worries about hefty spending on the technology
have mounted since low-cost AI models from China's DeepSeek
rattled the industry in January.
    Adding to uncertainty, a TD Cowen analyst note published
late on Friday reported that Microsoft Corp <MSFT.O> has
scrapped leases for sizeable data center capacity in the U.S.,
suggesting a potential oversupply of AI infrastructure.
    Microsoft said its plan to invest over $80 billion in AI and
cloud capacity this fiscal year was intact but that it ""may
strategically pace or adjust"" infrastructure in some areas.
    ""Markets are already jittery and looking for a reason to
take profits,"" said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at
Cetera Investment Management, noting that any question about AI
is seen as a reason to take profits since the technology has
driven market growth for the last few years. 
        Along with worries about tariffs and inflation,
investors are getting more anxious about economic growth after
last week's batch of weak economic data and a disappointing
forecast from Walmart <WMT.N>.
        ""Volatility is being driven by market uncertainty about
whether we're facing a growth scare or an inflation scare,"" said
Goldman. 
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 33.19 points,
or 0.08%, to 43,461.21, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 29.88 points, or
0.50%, to 5,983.25 and the Nasdaq <.IXIC> lost 237.08 points, or
1.21%, to 19,286.93.
        The more defensive healthcare index <.SPXHC> led

        WALL STREET ENDS MIXED AHEAD OF NVIDIA RESULTS,
INFLATION DATA
  
    Shares on Wall Street closed mixed on Monday, dragged down
by the Nasdaq indexes <.IXIC> <.NDX> ahead of Nvidia's results
on Wednesday. 
    The Nvidia earnings report is the company's first since the
DeepSeek-driven selloff on January 27, when investors raised
serious doubts about artificial intelligence spending. At the
company's conference call, investors will be looking for
comments about Nvidia's reaction to DeepSeek and its impact on
future AI spending.
    Nvidia <NVDA.O> fell 3.1% on Monday.
    Together with worries about tariffs and inflation, investors
are getting more concerned about U.S. growth prospects after
last week's batch of weak economic data and a disappointing
forecast from Walmart <WMT.N>
    ""Recent economic and survey data do raise some warning
flags, but S&P 500 companies delivered strong growth along with
continued record profitability last quarter,"" writes Scott
Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X, in emailed
comments.
    ""Fundamentals will ultimately win out, but waning sentiment
could well lead broad equity indexes sideways for a little
while.""
    Apple <AAPL.O>, meanwhile, reversed premarket declines to
gain around 0.6%. The iPhone maker unveiled plans to spend $500
billion in U.S. investments in the next four years, including
setting up a giant factory in Texas for AI servers.
    Market participants will also look to Friday's release of
the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Federal
Reserve's preferred inflation measure
    Global X's Helfstein says the PCE is ""expected to be above
Fed target,"" but would still suggest a stable, if slightly hot
inflation backdrop. ""If there is a surprise jump, that increases
the economic risks associated with the White House's tariff
agenda, but that is not our base case,"" he adds.

       Feb 24 (Reuters) - 
    The Nasdaq composite closed down more than 1% on Monday,
with big technology stocks creating the biggest drag as
investors worried about demand for technology supporting
artificial intelligence while they waited for results from
market heavyweight Nvidia.
    The S&P 500 closed slightly lower while the Dow was close to
unchanged.
    Demand for Nvidia's <NVDA.O>'s pricey AI chips will be in
focus when it reports results on Wednesday. Investors have been
questioning hefty spending on the technology since low-cost AI
models from China's DeepSeek rattled the industry in January.
    Adding to uncertainty, a TD Cowen analyst note published
late on Friday reported that Microsoft Corp <MSFT.O> has
scrapped leases for sizeable data center capacity in the U.S.,
suggesting a potential oversupply of AI infrastructure.
    Microsoft said its plan to invest over $80 billion in AI and
cloud capacity this fiscal year was intact but that it ""may
strategically pace or adjust"" infrastructure in some areas.
    ""Markets are already jittery and looking for a reason to
take profits,"" said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at
Cetera Investment Management, noting that any question about AI
is seen as a reason to take profits since the technology has
driven market growth for the last few years. 
        And, along with worries about tariffs and inflation,
investors are getting more anxious about economic growth after
last week's batch of weak economic data and a disappointing
forecast from Walmart <WMT.N>.
        ""Volatility is being driven by market uncertainty about
whether we're facing a growth scare or an inflation scare,"" said
Goldman. 
    According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 29.18
points, or 0.49%, to end at 5,983.95 points, while the Nasdaq
Composite <.IXIC> lost 238.49 points, or 1.22%, to 19,285.51.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 33.93 points, or
0.08%, to 43,469.97.
        The more defensive healthcare index <.SPXHC> was leading
percentage gains throughout the session while technology

       Feb 24 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were mixed
in choppy trading on Monday, with technology stocks creating the
biggest drag as investors awaited results from chip giant Nvidia
for clues on the future of demand for artificial intelligence
technology.
    The Dow and the S&P 500 managed small gains. The tech-heavy
Nasdaq composite slipped.  
        Adding to uncertainty, a TD Cowen analyst report
published late on Friday said Microsoft has scrapped leases for
sizeable data center capacity in the U.S., suggesting a

    Microsoft said its plan to invest over $80 billion in AI and

said it ""may strategically pace or adjust"" infrastructure in
some areas.
    The report came weeks after the launch of low-cost AI models
from China's DeepSeek stoked doubts about whether U.S. companies
were spending too much on the technology and overestimating
future demand. 
    ""Markets are already jittery and looking for a reason to

<.SPLRCT>, down 0.5%.

    By Stephen Nellis
       Feb 24 (Reuters) - Apple <AAPL.O> said on Monday it
would spend $500 billion in U.S. investments in the next four
years that will include a giant factory in Texas for artificial
intelligence servers and add about 20,000 research and
development jobs across the country in that time.
    That $500 billion in expected spending includes everything
from purchases from U.S. suppliers to U.S. filming of television
shows and movies for its Apple TV+ service. The company declined
to say how much of the figure it was already planning to spend
with its U.S. supply base, which includes firms such as Corning
<GLW.N> that makes glass for iPhones in Kentucky.
    The move comes after media reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook
met President Donald Trump last week. Many of Apple's products
that are assembled in China could face 10% tariffs imposed by
Trump earlier this month, though the iPhone maker had secured
some waivers from China tariffs during the first Trump
administration.
    ""This pledge represents a political gesture towards the
Trump administration,"" said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson,
who estimated Apple has already committed to spend more than
$150 billion per year in the United States, including cost of
goods sold and capital expenditure.
    ""Even without growing that spend very much, they would only
need 3 to 4 years to meet their obligation.""
    Apple made a similar announcement about its U.S. spending
plans in 2018, during the first Trump administration, when it
said its new and ongoing investments would contribute $350
billion to the U.S. economy over five years.
    The company's shares were up 1.2%.
    Trump, in a Truth Social post, thanked Apple and Cook,
saying the move reflected the company's faith in his
administration.
    Most of Apple's consumer products are assembled outside the
U.S., though many of Apple components are still made there,
including chips from Broadcom <AVGO.O>, Skyworks Solutions
<SWKS.O> and Qorvo <QRVO.O>.
    Apple said it last month started mass producing chips of its
own design at an Arizona factory owned by Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co <2330.TW>.
    Bringing TSMC to Arizona and helping introduce legislation
that later became the CHIPS Act to bolster U.S. semiconductor
production were two of Trump's biggest industrial policy moves
during his first term.
    Apple said on Monday it will work with Foxconn, formally
known as Hon Hai Precision Industry <2317.TW>, to build a
250,000-square-foot facility in Houston, where it will assemble
servers that go into data centers to power Apple Intelligence,
its suite of AI features that help draft emails and perform
other tasks. Those servers are currently made outside of the
U.S., Apple said.
    Apple said it plans to increase its Advanced Manufacturing
Fund from $5 billion to $10 billion, with part of the expansion
being a ""multibillion-dollar commitment from Apple to produce
advanced silicon"" at TSMC's Arizona factory.
    Apple did not disclose details of its deal with TSMC, but it
has in the past used the fund to help partners build out the
infrastructure needed to deliver products or services for Apple.
    Apple will also open a manufacturing academy in Michigan
where its engineers, along with local university staff, will
offer free courses for small and mid-sized manufacturing firms
in areas such as project management and manufacturing process
optimization.

2025-02-24 19:06:12,BREAKINGVIEWS-Apple’s $500 bln reveal has iPhone-like ring to it,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250224:nL3N3PF10G:8,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.  The opinions
expressed are his own.)
    By Robert Cyran
       NEW YORK, Feb 24 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple
<AAPL.O> has mastered the art of hyping the ho-hum. The iPhone
maker’s semi-regular product presentations carry on a mystique
created by late founder Steve Jobs, even when the updates are
rather ordinary. Boss Tim Cook is borrowing the approach for his
latest $500 billion reveal.
    The figure, unveiled on Monday, represents the amount Apple
intends to spend in the United States over the next four years.
It includes everything from hiring 20,000 workers to building a
server factory in Houston to funding blockbuster films for its
streaming service. Half a trillion dollars sprinkled around the
country is also the sort of commitment that can buy some
goodwill with President Donald Trump.
    Many such announcements tend to be flimsy or ephemeral.
Foxconn’s plan to build a $10 billion plant and create 13,000
jobs in Wisconsin, rolled out in 2017 after Trump first took
office, is the archetype of the genre. The Taiwanese
manufacturer later dramatically scaled back the project. A
promised $500 billion artificial intelligence initiative from
OpenAI, SoftBank <9984.T> and Oracle <ORCL.N> has the potential
to go the same way. Apple’s blueprint, is more plausible.
    In 2021, it said it would allocate $430 billion to the U.S.
over five years and is on track to do so. On that basis, Apple
has gone from earmarking about $85 billion a year to about $125
billion, or increase domestic spending about 10% annually. The
rate is roughly the same as recent growth for operating costs
and investment, with a bit more thrown in to bring some
production home.
    Although it would be a healthy outlay, it pales compared to
some other technology splurges. For example, Microsoft's
<MSFT.O> capital expenditure alone over roughly the next four
years is expected to be some $400 billion, according to Visible
Alpha, more than twice as much as during the previous four.
Similarly, Apple’s latest hiring pledge is the same as the ones
it made in both 2018 and 2021.
    Why make such a big deal of what’s mostly business as usual?
For one thing, Apple is more vulnerable than peers to
intensifying trade wars. About 15% of its nearly $400 billion in
revenue in the year to September 28 came from China, which is
also a big manufacturing hub for its devices. Higher tariffs
probably would mean higher U.S. prices for its gadgets, while
any retaliation would threaten sales in China. Although Apple’s
financial update is largely incremental, creating a little buzz,
in the White House at least, may yet generate some substance.
    Follow @rob_cyran on X
         
    CONTEXT NEWS 
    Apple said on February 24 that it would spend more than $500
billion in the United States over the next four years and hire
at least 20,000 people, mostly to work in research, software
development and artificial intelligence.
    The spending commitment includes payments to suppliers,
direct employment, Apple data centers, corporate facilities and
Apple TV+ production. It also earmarks $5 billion for its U.S.
manufacturing fund, which will double its size.
    As part of the package, Apple said it would be working with
partners to open a 250,000-square-foot facility to assemble
servers in Houston in 2026.

2025-02-24 17:49:31,Berkshire Hathaway shares rise to new high after record profit,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250224:nL2N3PF0R4:6,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"By Jonathan Stempel
       Feb 24 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway <BRKa.N> shares
rose to a record on Monday after the conglomerate run by Warren
Buffett posted its highest-ever quarterly profit, driven by
improvement in insurance operations.
    The price of Berkshire's Class A shares rose as much as 4.3%
to $749,611 by early afternoon, NYSE data show.
    That surpassed even the $741,971 recorded by some stock
price services last June 3 following a trading glitch.
    It boosted the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's market
value to about $1.08 trillion. Multiple analysts raised their
price targets and earnings forecasts. Buffett's own net worth
surpassed $155 billion, according to Forbes magazine.
    Berkshire on Saturday said fourth-quarter profit from its
189 operating businesses rose 71% to $14.53 billion, and
excluding currency gains totaled $13.38 billion, exceeding
analyst forecasts.
    Full-year operating profit rose 27% to $47.44 billion, also
a record.
    That was also helped by more income from $334.2 billion of
cash and equivalents, invested mainly in U.S. Treasury bills.
    Cash doubled in 2024 as Berkshire reduced its stake in Apple
<AAPL.O>, which remained its largest common stock holding.
    In his annual shareholder letter, Buffett said Berkshire
outpaced his expectations, and singled out Geico Chief Executive
Todd Combs for improving the car insurer's underwriting while
cutting costs.
    Geico underwriting profit more than doubled in 2024 even as
it shed more than 2,300 jobs, in addition to 7,700 in 2023.
    UBS analyst Brian Meredith and KBW analyst Meyer Shields
raised their 2025 outlooks for Berkshire, with Meredith saying
Geico ""appears to have firmly turned the corner.""
    Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan called the cash stake
noteworthy in light of Buffett's comment that Berkshire paid
$26.8 billion, or more than $3 million an hour, in federal taxes
last year. Buffett cautioned Washington to spend it ""wisely.""
    Berkshire's operations also include railroad, energy,
industrial, retail and service businesses.
    Buffett, 94, has led Berkshire since 1965.
    He wrote that ""at 94, it won't be long before Greg Abel
replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters.""
Abel, 62, is a Berkshire vice chairman.

    By Stephen Nellis
       Feb 24 (Reuters) - Apple <AAPL.O> on Monday said it
plans to help bring online a quarter-million-square-foot factory
in Texas by 2026 to build artificial intelligence servers and
will add about 20,000 research and development jobs across the
U.S.
    Apple said that it plans to spend $500 billion in the United
States over the next four years, though that figure includes
everything from purchases from U.S. suppliers to U.S. filming of
television shows and movies for its Apple TV+ service. The
company declined to say how much of the figure it was already
planning to spend with its existing U.S. supply base, which
includes firms such as Corning <GLW.N>, which makes glass for
iPhones in Kentucky.
    The move comes after media reports that Apple Chief
Executive Tim Cook met with President Donald Trump last week.
Many of Apple's products that are assembled in China could face
10% tariffs imposed by Trump earlier this month, though the
iPhone maker previously secured some waivers from China tariffs
during the first Trump administration.
    Apple made a similar announcement about its U.S. spending
plans during the first Trump administration, at that time saying
it planned $350 billion over five years.
    Most of Apple's consumer products are assembled outside the
U.S., though many of Apple components are still made there,
including chips from Broadcom <AVGO.O>, SkyWorks Solutions
<SWKS.O> and Qorovo <QRVO.O>. Apple also said that it last month
started mass producing chips of its own design at an Arizona
factory owned Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co <2330.TW>
(TSMC).
    Bringing TSMC to Arizona and helping introduce legislation
that later became the CHIPS Act to bolster U.S. semiconductor
production were two of Trump's biggest industrial policy moves
during his first term.
    Apple said on Monday that it will work with Hon Hai
Precision Industry's <2317.TW> Foxconn to build a
250,000-squre-foot facility in Houston, where it will assemble
servers that go into data centers to power Apple Intelligence,
its suite of AI features that help draft emails and perform
other tasks. Those servers are currently made outside of the
U.S., Apple said.
    Apple also said it plans to increase its Advanced
Manufacturing Fund from $5 billion to $10 billion, with part of
the expansion being a ""multibillion-dollar commitment from Apple
to produce advanced silicon"" at TSMC's Arizona factory. Apple
did not disclose details of its deal with TSMC, but it has in
the past used the fund to help partners build out the
infrastructure needed to deliver products or services for Apple.
    Apple will also open a manufacturing academy in Michigan
where its engineers, along with local university staff, will
offer free courses for small and mid-sized manufacturing firms
in areas such as project management and manufacturing process
optimization.

2025-02-23 19:16:14,UPDATE 1-US demands EU antitrust chief clarify rules reining in Big Tech,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250223:nL2N3PE06Z:1,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"(Adds detail in paragraph 5, the European Commission did not
respond to request for comment)
    By Foo Yun Chee
       BRUSSELS, Feb 23 (Reuters) - U.S. House Judiciary Chair
Jim Jordan on Sunday demanded EU antitrust chief Teresa Ribera
clarify how she enforces the European Union's rules reining in
Big Tech, saying they appear to target U.S. companies.
    The request came two days after U.S. President Donald Trump
signed a memorandum warning that his administration would
scrutinise the EU's Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services
Act ""that dictate how American companies interact with consumers
in the European Union"".
    The Digital Markets Act sets out a list of dos and don'ts
for Alphabet <GOOGL.O>, Amazon <AMZN.O>, Apple <AAPL.O>,
Booking.com <BKNG.O>, ByteDance, Meta Platforms <META.O>,
Microsoft <MSFT.O>, aimed at securing a level playing field and
giving consumers more choices.
        ""We write to express our concerns that the DMA may
target American companies,"" Jordan wrote in a letter sent to
Ribera on Sunday and seen by Reuters, saying that the rules
subject companies to burdensome regulations and give European
companies an advantage. 
    Scott Fitzgerald, chairman of the subcommittee on the
administrative state, regulatory reform and antitrust, was a
co-signatory to the letter. 
    The letter criticised fines up to 10% of global annual
revenues for DMA violations.
    ""These severe fines appear to have two goals: to compel
businesses to follow European standards worldwide, and as a
European tax on American companies,"" Jordan and Fitzgerald said.
    They also took a swipe at the DMA requirements, saying some
of them could benefit China.
    ""These, along with other provisions of the DMA, stifle 
innovation, disincentivize research and development, and hand
vast amounts of highly valuable proprietary data to companies
and adversarial nations,"" the letter said.
    The two urged Ribera to brief the judiciary committee by
March 10.
    The European Commission did not respond to a request for
comment on Sunday.
    The European Commission, where Ribera is the second most
powerful official after its president, Ursula von der Leyen, has
denied taking aim at American companies. 
    Ribera in an interview with Reuters last Monday said the EU

    By Jonathan Stempel
       NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway <BRKa.N>
on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash
stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual
shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely
and take care of those who get the ""short straws in life.""
    Buffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S.
lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make
them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald
Trump.
    The 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person
and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his
advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend
less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting
on May 3.
    He nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good
hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice
Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has ""vividly
shown his ability"" to deploy capital.
    ""It won't be long"" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.
    Buffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual
report, where it reported a third straight record annual
operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.
    Quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also
a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.
    Net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including
gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple
<AAPL.O> and American Express <AXP.N>.
    Berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations
and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it
bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest
stock investment.
    ""Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find
ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,"" Buffett wrote.
    
    'FISCAL FOLLY'
    This year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which
he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03
trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance,
railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.
    ""Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our
country. And we are not finished,"" Buffett said.
    Buffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities,
primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a
dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967. 
    He said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha,
Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last
year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself
is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,
    But he also sent a cautionary message to Washington,
lamenting how capitalism ""has its faults and abuses--in certain
respects more egregious now than ever,"" with malfeasance by
""scoundrels and promoters"" in full force.
    He urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar,
saying ""fiscal folly"" can destroy the value of paper money and
the country has at times ""come close to the edge.""
    Buffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American
economy, which he called the ""American miracle,"" has depended on
people's ability to participate.
    That, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take
away.
    ""Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get
the short straws in life. They deserve better,"" Buffett wrote,
addressing the government.
    ""And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable
currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on
your part,"" he added.
    Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates
Berkshire ""hold,"" said: ""Talking about the business of America
being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape
and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning
Washington: Be careful where you tread.""

    FEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES
    While Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire
company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its
combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading
houses: Itochu <8001.T>, Marubeni <8002.T>, Mitsubishi <8058.T>,
Mitsui <8031.T> and Sumitomo <8053.T>.
    Other stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500
<.SPX> hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq <.IXIC>
just 3% below its December 16 peak.
    Berkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the
indexes, as they did decades ago.
    The company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year,
while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.
    Over the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen
225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185%
excluding dividends, Reuters data show.
    ""They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire
will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,""
said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital
Management in Phoenix.
    At Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time
on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice
Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.
    Tens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend
of shareholder events, including shopping.
    Buffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still
having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while
other activities had been ""eliminated or greatly minimized.""
    The meeting will also not feature the traditional movie
created by Buffett's daughter Susie.
    In discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on
Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an
old-fashioned phone.
    ""We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting
topics as the relative merits of our canes,"" he said. ""In my
case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on
my face.""

    By Jonathan Stempel
       Feb 22 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway
<BRKa.N> on Saturday said operating profit set a record in the
fourth quarter and for the third straight calendar year,
bolstered by improved underwriting and higher investment income
in its insurance businesses.
    Much of that income came from Berkshire's enormous cash
stake, which ended 2024 at a record $334.2 billion, twice as
much as a year earlier.
    In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, the
94-year-old Buffett assured that Berkshire would prefer
investing in businesses to holding cash.
    But he also said his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate ""did
better than I expected,"" though 53% of its 189 operating
businesses posted lower earnings.
    He attributed the improvement in part to higher yields on
U.S. Treasury bills, and improvement at the Geico car insurer,
which benefited from improved pricing and tighter underwriting
as loss rates from accidents declined.
    ""Those were incredible numbers,"" said Thomas Russo, a
partner at Gardner Russo & Quinn in Lancaster, Pennsylvania,
which has owned Berkshire stock since the 1980s. ""You really saw
the power of Berkshire's insurance operations and investments.""
    Buffett singled out Todd Combs, Geico's chief executive
since 2020 and also a Berkshire investment manager, saying he
has ""reshaped Geico in a major way"" by increasing efficiency and
improving underwriting, though more work remains.
        Geico cut more than 2,300 jobs last year, and has shed
about 10,000 jobs--26% of its workforce--since the end of 2022.
  
        
  
    NO BUYBACKS
        Operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion in the
fourth quarter, and 27% to $47.44 billion in 2024.
    Quarterly net income totaled $19.69 billion, or $13,695 per
average equivalent share, as the value of Berkshire's holdings
in Apple <AAPL.O>, American Express <AXP.N> and other stocks
increased. For the year, net income totaled $89 billion.
    Buffett considers net results misleading because they
include gains and losses on investments that Berkshire has not
sold and sometimes has no plan to sell.
    The increased cash stake in 2024 largely came from $143.4
billion of stock sales, including 62% of Berkshire's holdings in
Apple and one-third of its stake in Bank of America <BAC.N>.
    Berkshire has been a net seller of stocks for nine
consecutive quarters.
    Meanwhile, Berkshire spent just $2.9 billion repurchasing
its own stock in 2024. Through February 10, it has conducted no
repurchases since last May.
    Bill Smead, a longtime Berkshire investor at Smead Capital
Management in Phoenix, noted Buffett's comment in the annual
letter that Berkshire only ""very infrequently"" finds itself
knee-deep in things to buy.
        ""He is saying: nothing looks compelling,"" Smead said.
  
        
  
        LOS ANGELES WILDFIRES
  
        Geico's pretax underwriting profit rose 29% in the
fourth quarter, and more than doubled in 2024 as the percentage
of premiums used to pay claims fell to 71.8% from 81% in 2023.
Rate increases offset a small decline in the number of policies.
  
        While overall insurance underwriting profit quadrupled
in the fourth quarter, Berkshire projected a $1.3 billion
pre-tax hit from last month's wildfires in the Los Angeles area.
  
        Profit at the BNSF railroad fell 6% in the fourth
quarter and 1% in 2024.
  
        Full-year profit also declined in Berkshire's retail and
service businesses, as margins fell at the Pilot truck stop
chain and at Berkshire' namesake car dealership business.
  
        Profit also declined at mobile home unit Clayton Homes,
reflecting higher insurance claims and projected loan losses.
  
        Full-year profit at Berkshire Hathaway Energy rose by
more than half as utility margins increased, and the PacifiCorp
utility set aside less money for litigation arising from Oregon
and California wildfires in 2020.
  
        Buffett disclosed that Berkshire paid $3.9 billion late
last year to buy the 8% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy it did not
already own.
  
        Berkshire also owns a variety of industrial companies,
as well as consumer brands such as Dairy Queen, Fruit of the
Loom and See's Candies.

 (Adds details from White House fact sheet and background
throughout)
    By Nandita Bose, David Lawder and Steve Holland
       WASHINGTON, Feb 21 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on
Friday ordered his trade chief to revive investigations aimed at
imposing tariffs on imports from countries that levy digital
service taxes on U.S. technology companies.
    A White House official, providing details of the order, said
Trump was directing his administration to consider responsive
actions like tariffs ""to combat the digital service taxes
(DSTs), fines, practices, and policies that foreign governments
levy on American companies.""
        ""President Trump will not allow foreign governments to
appropriate America's tax base for their own benefit,"" the
official said.
        The memo directs the U.S. Trade Representative's office
to renew digital service taxes investigations that were
initiated during Trump's first term, and investigate any
additional countries that use a digital tax ""to discriminate
against U.S. companies,"" according to a White House fact sheet.
    The digital service taxes aimed at dominant U.S. tech giants
including Alphabet's Google <GOOGL.O>, Meta's Facebook <META.O>,
Apple <AAPL.O> and Amazon <AMZN.O> have been a longstanding
trade irritant for multiple U.S. administrations.
        Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, India, Austria
and Canada have levied the taxes on sales revenue by these and
other digital services providers within their borders. 
        During Trump's first term, USTR launched Section 301
unfair trade practices against several of these countries,
finding they discriminated against U.S. companies, paving the
way for retaliatory tariffs on certain imports.
        ""What they're doing to us in other countries is terrible
with digital,"" Trump told reporters ahead of his memo signing.
        He previewed the action last week, saying that he would 
impose tariffs on goods from Canada and France over their
digital service taxes. A White House fact sheet released at the
time said each had collected over $500 million annually in DST
revenues, with global levies at over $2 billion.
    Trump's memo also directs his administration to review
whether any policy in the European Union or Britain
""incentivizes U.S. companies to develop or use products and
technology in ways that undermine free speech or foster
censorship.""
    The White House fact sheet said that it will especially 
scrutinize how U.S. firms are treated under the EU's Digital
Markets Act and Digital Services Act.
        Sources told Reuters earlier on Friday that Google is
set to be charged with breaching the Digital Markets Act after
proposed changes to its search results failed to address the EU
antitrust regulator's concerns and those of its rivals.
        
  
        BATON PASS
    After Trump's first administration launched the digital tax
probes, former President Joe Biden's trade chief, Katherine Tai,
in 2021 followed up by announcing 25% tariffs on over $2 billion
worth of imports from six countries, but immediately suspended
them to allow negotiations on a global tax deal to continue.
    Those negotiations led to a 15% global corporate minimum tax
that the U.S. Congress never ratified. Talks on a second
component, meant to create an alternative to the digital taxes,
have largely ground to a halt with no agreement.
    Trump on his first day in office effectively pulled the U.S.
out of the global tax arrangement with nearly 140 countries,
declaring that the 15% global minimum tax has ""no force or
effect in the United States"" and ordering the U.S. Treasury to
prepare options for ""protective measures.""
    Trump did not disclose how high a tariff rate he would
charge on the retaliatory duties, nor the value of goods
targeted. 
    In 2021, Tai announced that USTR would impose 25% tariffs on
about $887 million worth of goods from Britain, including
clothing, footwear and cosmetics, and on about $386 million
worth of goods from Italy, including clothing, handbags and
optical lenses. 
    USTR said at the time it would impose tariffs on goods worth
$323 million from Spain, $310 million from Turkey, $118 million
from India and $65 million from Austria. USTR separately
suspended tariffs on $1.3 billion worth of French cosmetics,
handbags and other goods.

 (Adds quotes from Electronic Frontier Foundation and Signal
executive)
    By Aditya Soni and Stephen Nellis
       Feb 21 (Reuters) - Apple <AAPL.O> is scrapping its most
advanced security encryption feature for cloud data in Britain,
the company said on Friday, an unprecedented response to
government demands for access to user data.
    The change affects a feature called Advanced Data Protection
(ADP), which extends end-to-end encryption across a wide range
of cloud data. Apple said it is no longer available in Britain
for new users, with those who try to turn it on receiving an
error message starting Friday, and that current users will
eventually need to disable this security feature.
    The move means iCloud backups in Britain will no longer have
that level of encryption, allowing Apple to access in certain
cases user data that it otherwise could not, such as copies of
iMessages, and hand it over to authorities if legally compelled.
With end-to-end encryption enabled, even Apple cannot access the
data.
        ""Apple's decision to disable the feature for UK users
could well be the only reasonable response at this point, but it
leaves those people at the mercy of bad actors and deprives them
of a key privacy-preserving technology,"" said Andrew Crocker,
surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier
Foundation.
  
    Governments and tech giants have long been locked in a
battle over strong encryption to protect consumers'
communications, which the authorities view as a mettlesome
obstacle to mass surveillance and crime fighting programs. But
such a demand from Britain would be particularly sweeping. 
     Early plans to let Apple users fully encrypt backups of
their devices to the company's iCloud service were dropped in or
around 2018 after the FBI privately complained, Reuters has
previously reported, but the company eventually went forward
with the plan in 2022.     
    ""Lawful access to digital evidence and threat information is
rapidly eroding,"" the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation says
on its website, citing ""warrant-proof encryption"".
    Apple has long said that it would never build a so-called
backdoor into its encrypted services or devices, because once
one is created, it could be exploited by hackers in addition to
governments, a sentiment echoed by security experts.
    ""Ultimately, once a door exists, it's only a matter of time
before it's found and used maliciously. Removing ADP is not just
a symbolic concession but a practical weakening of iCloud
security for UK users,"" said Professor Oli Buckley, a professor
in cybersecurity at Loughborough University in Britain.
    Data that was encrypted before Apple launched its protection
service in late 2022, such as passwords and iMessage and
FaceTime messaging services, will remain encrypted.
    ""We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided
by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given
the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to
customer privacy,"" Apple said in a statement.
    The change does not affect encryption of data stored
directly on its devices, but in the era of large photo
collections, huge messaging histories and regular phone
upgrades, many users find it impractical to store all their data
on their device alone. 
    Device-only storage also means that if the device is lost or
damaged, all of a user's data could disappear, which drives many
if not most consumers to opt for some form of cloud backup that
now will be easier for British authorities to access.
 
 SECURITY CONCERNS
Law enforcement agencies have frequently targeted Apple services
including iMessage through iCloud backups, which were not
end-to-end encrypted before Apple offered Advanced Data
Protection.
    Those backups - which can contain photos and other sensitive
information and are widely used - can no longer be end-to-end
encrypted for UK users, Apple said. 
    While Apple cannot disable ADP for existing users as it does
not hold encryption keys, it will prompt users to turn off the
feature themselves.
    A spokesperson for Britain's Home Office declined to comment
on whether such an order had been issued. ""We do not comment on
operational matters, including for example confirming or denying
the existence of any such notices,"" the spokesperson said.
    The Washington Post reported this month that Britain issued
Apple a Technical Capability Notice, requiring access under the
broad Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows law
enforcement to compel firms to assist in evidence collection.
    Technical Capability Notices (TCNs) do not grant blanket
access to users' personal data, according to the government's
website. Even with a TCN in place, separate authorizations are
still required to allow access to data.
    Australia has a similar law, and could follow Britain's
lead, said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist
with nonprofit group Internet Society.
        ""The one thing we see with Commonwealth countries is the
second one does something, the others tend to do that. And so I
would expect Australia to issue a Technical Capability Notice
that probably mirrors this, given their own laws.""
  
        Hall also noted that Alphabet's <GOOGL.O> Android
operating system also offers encrypted backups.
  
    Apple shares ended largely unchanged on Friday.
        The company has long resisted government efforts to
weaken encryption, including in 2016 when U.S. authorities tried
to compel it to unlock the iPhone of a San Bernardino shooter.
    Efforts to subvert it date back to the 1990s, when former
U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration first proposed
adding a physical chip to computer hardware that would give cops
and spies a way of eavesdropping on encrypted communications. 
    The effort foundered, and strong encryption has since made
its way into an increasing number of consumer services,
including Apple's iMessage, Zoom meetings, Meta's <META.O>
WhatsApp and the privacy-focused app Signal. 
    Some U.S. officials have encouraged the use of encrypted
services in the wake of December's widespread Salt Typhoon hack
on U.S. telecommunications firms. 
     Meredith Whittaker, president of Signal, which has
previously threatened to leave Britain over similar concerns,
called Britain's move ""technically illiterate"" and said that it
would hurt the country's efforts to cultivate its tech sector.
        ""You can’t be tech-friendly while eroding the foundation
of cybersecurity on which robust tech depends. Encryption is not
a luxury - it is a fundamental human right essential to a free
society that also happens to underpin the global economy,""
Whittaker said.

 (Updates to market close)
    By Stephen Culp
       NEW YORK, Feb 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks tumbled on
Friday, extending their selloff in the wake of dour economic
reports and closing the book on a holiday-shortened week fraught
with new tariff threats and worries of softening consumer
demand.
    All three major U.S. stock indexes moved decisively lower on
the heels of the data, and continued their slide into afternoon
trading. All three also posted steep weekly losses.
    ""I don't like all this red on a Friday,"" said Greg Bassuk,
CEO at AXS Investments in New York. ""We're seeing consumer
sentiment, tariffs and corporate earnings having leap-frogged AI
and technology as the primary drivers of market direction.""
    Economic data showed U.S. business activity decelerating and
consumer sentiment deteriorating, with survey participants
expressing an increasingly gloomy outlook in the face of
economic unknowns.
    The data comes on the heels of Walmart's <WMT.N>
disappointing guidance on Thursday, which sparked fears of
dampening consumer demand.
    U.S. businesses' optimism has ""evaporated,"" according to PMI
commentary provided by S&P Global's chief economist Chris
Williamson, amid ""a darkening picture of heightened
uncertainty.""  
    ""Uncertainty is the new investor narrative,"" Bassuk added.
""It's sparking the volatility that we've seen this week.""
        ""We're anticipating that the uncertainty and the
volatility is going to remain at least through the end of this
first quarter."" 
  
    Economically sensitive sectors, such as Dow Transports
<.DJI>, chips <.SOX>, smallcaps <.RUT>, housing <.HGX>, and
consumer discretionary <.SPLRCD> slid more than 2%. 
    The CBOE volatility index <.VIX> touched its highest level
since February 4.
    This week, U.S. President Donald Trump said he will soon
announce new tariffs covering lumber and forest products, in
addition to previously announced plans to impose duties on
imported cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.
    According to preliminary data, the S&P 500
<.SPX> lost 104.01 points, or 1.70%, to end at 6,013.46 points,
while the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> lost 434.97 points, or 2.20%,
to 19,524.01. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
<.DJI> fell 751.33 points, or 1.69%, to 43,428.02. 
    Fourth-quarter earnings season is in its final stretch. Some
425 of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported, with 76% of
them beating Wall Street expectations, according to LSEG.
    Analysts now see aggregate fourth-quarter S&P 500 earnings
growth of 15.7% year-on-year, a significant improvement over the
7.8% annual growth prediction as on Jan. 1, per LSEG.
    Shares of UnitedHealth <UNH.N> tumbled following a Wall
Street Journal report that the Department of Justice has
launched an investigation into the health insurer's Medicare
billing practices.
    Block <XYZ.N> slid after the payment firm's fourth-quarter
profit fell short of estimates.
    Akamai Technologies <AKAM.O> dropped as the cybersecurity
company forecast annual 2025 revenue below estimates. 
    Electric vehicle makers Tesla <TSLA.O>, Rivian <RIVN.O> both
lost ground after they both announced recalls.

       NEW YORK, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street tumbled on
Friday, extending its selloff in the wake of dour economic
reports, closing the door on a holiday-shortened week fraught
with new tariff threats and worries of softening consumer
demand.
    All three major U.S. stock indexes moved decisively lower on
the heels of the data, and continued their slide into afternoon
trading.
    The indexes are on track to post weekly losses, with the S&P
500 and the Nasdaq setting course for their biggest weekly drop
since early January, and the Dow on the road to its largest
Friday-to-Friday plunge since mid-October.
    Economic data showed U.S. business activity decelerating and
consumer sentiment deteriorating, with survey participants
expressing an increasingly gloomy outlook in the face of
economic unknowns.
    U.S. businesses' optimism has ""evaporated,"" according to PMI
commentary provided by S&P Global's chief economist Chris
Williamson, amid ""a darkening picture of heightened
uncertainty.""  
    ""The Michigan survey data, showed a significant retreat (in
sentiment),"" said Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify
Asset Management in Philadelphia. ""The key story here continues
to be a tremendous amount of uncertainty ... it feels like we
could walk in tomorrow and markets could be down 20%"" 
    Economically sensitive sectors, such as Dow Transports
<.DJI>, chips <.SOX>, smallcaps <.RUT>, housing <.HGX>, and
consumer discretionary <.SPLRCD> slid more than 2%. 
    Megacap momentum stocks <.NYFANG> were off 2.6%, and among
the ""magnificent 7"" group all but Apple <AAPL.O> were down more
than 1%, with Alphabet <GOOGL.O>, Nvidia <NVDA.O> Amazon
<AMZN.O> and Tesla <TSLA.O> down between 2.4% and 5.0%.
    The CBOE volatility index <.VIX> touched its highest level
since February 4.
    This week, U.S. President Donald Trump said he will soon
announce new tariffs covering lumber and forest products, in
addition to previously announced plans to impose duties on
imported cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. 
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 744.20 points,
or 1.68%, to 43,432.45, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 92.98 points, or
1.53%, to 6,024.54 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> lost 381.12
points, or 1.91%, to 19,581.24.
        Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, all but
consumer staples <.SPLRCS> were lower, with consumer
discretionary and industrials <.SPLRCI> suffering the steepest
percentage losses.
  
    Fourth-quarter earnings season is on the final stretch, with
425 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those,
76% have beaten Wall Street expectations, according to LSEG.
    Analysts now see aggregate fourth-quarter S&P 500 earnings
growth of 15.7% year-on-year, a significant improvement over the
7.8% annual growth prediction as on Jan. 1, per LSEG.
    Shares of UnitedHealth <UNH.N> tumbled 6.9% following a Wall
Street Journal report that the Department of Justice has
launched an investigation into the health insurer's Medicare
billing practices.
    Block <XYZ.N> tumbled 17.9% after the payment firm's
fourth-quarter profit fell short of estimates.
    Akamai Technologies <AKAM.O> dropped 20.6% as the
cybersecurity company forecast annual 2025 revenue below
estimates. 
    Electric vehicle makers Tesla <TSLA.O>, Rivian <RIVN.O> were
off 4.9% and 4.0%, respectively, after they both announced
recalls.
    Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.44-to-1 ratio
on the NYSE. There were 86 new highs and 94 new lows on the
NYSE.
    On the Nasdaq, 1,117 stocks rose and 3,216 fell as declining
issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.88-to-1 ratio.
    The S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and 7 new lows while
the Nasdaq Composite recorded 65 new highs and 113 new lows.

 (Updates shares in paragraph 1, market cap loss in paragraph 7, adds analyst comments in
paragraphs 13 and 16)
    By Manya Saini
       Feb 21 (Reuters) - Payments firm Block's <XYZ.N> shares tumbled 16% in morning trading
on Friday as a slowdown in spending growth fueled investor concerns, shifting the spotlight to
its bet on buy-now, pay-later lending to drive profits in 2025.
    Consumer spending growth has remained muted as Americans grapple with trade policy
uncertainty under the new Trump administration and persistently high interest rates, despite
support from a strong labor market and steady wage growth. 
    Block's Cash App business, which enables peer-to-peer mobile payments, reported gross profit
growth of about 16% in the holiday quarter, down from 25% a year earlier. 
    The digital payment space has become fiercely competitive, with tech giants including Apple
<AAPL.O> and Google <GOOGL.O> expanding their presence and industry heavyweights like PayPal
<PYPL.O> broadening offerings to retain cautious customers.
    ""The long-term economics of this (Cash App) business remain the biggest point of
uncertainty,"" said Brett Horn, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, noting that its growth
trajectory is ""still in question."" 
    Meanwhile, Block's business-focused Square unit reported gross profit growth of 12% in the
quarter, versus 18% a year earlier. 
    The company is set to shed roughly $8 billion in market value, if losses hold to session
close. 
    At least three brokerages lowered their price target on the stock after results. 
 
    
'NOW OR NEVER' YEAR
    Block expects gross profit to grow by at least 15% year-over-year in 2025, with margins
expanding by around 240 basis points. 
    Analysts view BNPL expansion as a key growth driver for Block, with Jefferies calling 2025 a
""now or never"" year for the company, while Oppenheimer said the full-year outlook for gross
profit growth will ""no doubt be a point of contention for investors.""  
    The BNPL market is projected to surpass $160 billion by 2032, with retailers including
Walmart, Target and Amazon, joining fintech players like Block and PayPal in offering the
service to attract younger, credit-averse shoppers.
    With its quick approval process, easy access, and a revenue model based on fees, BNPL is an
attractive proposition for fintech while traditional banks have been constrained by stricter
regulations, higher risk assessment standards, and a reliance on interest-based credit products.
    Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja said on a post-earnings call that Block expects Cash
App’s growth to accelerate as it scales Afterpay products, which it acquired in January 2022, on
the platform and invests in marketing.
    Oppenheimer analysts said the first quarter will likely be the weakest due to a leap year
and a stronger dollar but the brokerage said it remains optimistic about 2025.

       Feb 21 (Reuters) - A high-level Japanese group that
includes a former prime minister has drawn up plans for Tesla
<TSLA.O> to invest in Nissan <7201.T> after the collapse of its
merger talks with Honda <7267.T>, the Financial Times said on

include Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors <7211.T>.

United States, according to the Financial Times.
    The proposal is being led by former Tesla board member
Hiromichi Mizuno with support from ex-premier Yoshihide Suga and
his former aide Hiroto Izumi, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified sources.
    Some analysts, however, are doubtful of Tesla's interest in
acquiring U.S. plants, citing its ample capacity at existing
factories and first decline in yearly deliveries in 2024.
        Tesla said last month it expected the vehicle business
to 
    return to growth
     this year.
  
    Suga's office said it was not aware of a plan to encourage
Tesla to invest in Nissan. Suga stood down as prime minister in
2021 but remains a member of Japan's lower house, representing a
constituency in Nissan's home prefecture of Kanagawa.
    In a social media post, Mizuno said he had ""absolutely no
involvement"" in what was reported in the FT article, adding that
he doubted if Tesla had any interest at all in Nissan factories
given Tesla's unique factory design.
    Nissan declined to comment on the report, while Tesla did
not respond to requests for comment. Reuters was not immediately
able to contact Izumi.
        Matt Britzman, a senior equity analyst at Hargreaves
Lansdown, said there was no value for Tesla in investing in
infrastructure from a legacy carmaker.
    ""Tesla's secret weapon is the novel way its factories have
been designed and optimised for its cars,"" Britzman said.
    Nissan shares closed up 9.6% after the FT report. The
automaker and Honda ended talks to forge a $60-billion car
company last week. Nissan said it will seek new partnerships. 
    According to the FT, some Nissan board members have
suggested Tesla and Apple <AAPL.O> as ideal strategic investors.
    Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
    Acquiring Nissan's U.S. plants might make sense considering
President Donald Trump's plans to apply new tariffs on auto
imports, and separate tariffs on Mexico and Canada, said
Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein.
        ""The cost to build a new auto plant is high, so if Tesla
is able to acquire an existing plant that greatly reduces the
cost,"" he said.
  
    Tesla ended 2024 with $36.56 billion in cash and
equivalents, giving it a large war chest for any deal, although
it has shown little appetite for investing in auto companies.
    Sources have previously told Reuters that Nissan was open to
working with new partners, with the world's largest contract
electronics manufacturer Foxconn seen as one candidate.
    Later on Friday, the Nikkei newspaper reported that through
partnering with Honda, Foxconn aimed to form a broader framework
for cooperation to compete against Tesla and Chinese EV makers.
    Honda declined to comment on the Nikkei report. Foxconn
representatives did not immediately reply to a comment request.
    Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida said last week that Nissan and
Foxconn had not held talks at management level. A day before
Uchida made his remarks, the Taiwanese firm's chairman had said
it would consider taking a stake in Nissan for cooperation.

2025-02-21 12:28:02,Block shares drop as spending slowdown puts BNPL expansion in focus,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250221:nL3N3PC0SI:4,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"By Manya Saini
       Feb 21 (Reuters) - Payments firm Block's <XYZ.N> shares fell 8% in premarket trading on
Friday as a slowdown in spending growth fueled investor concerns, turning the spotlight to its
bet on buy-now, pay-later lending to drive profits in 2025.
    Consumer spending growth has remained muted as Americans grapple with trade policy
uncertainty under the new Trump administration and persistently high interest rates, despite
support from a strong labor market and steady wage growth. 
    Block's Cash App business, which enables peer-to-peer mobile payments, reported gross profit
growth of about 16% in the holiday quarter, down from 25% a year earlier. 
    The digital payment space has become fiercely competitive, with tech giants including Apple
<AAPL.O> and Google <GOOGL.O> expanding their presence and industry heavyweights like PayPal
<PYPL.O> broadening offerings to retain cautious customers.
    ""The long-term economics of this (Cash App) business remain the biggest point of
uncertainty,"" said Brett Horn, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, noting that its growth
trajectory is ""still in question."" 
    Meanwhile, Block's business-focused Square unit reported gross profit growth of 12% in the
quarter, versus 18% a year earlier. 
     
'NOW OR NEVER' YEAR
      Block expects gross profit to grow by at least 15% year-over-year in 2025, with margins
expanding by around 240 basis points. 
    Analysts view BNPL expansion as a key growth driver for Block, with Jefferies calling 2025 a
""now or never"" year for the company. 
    The BNPL market is projected to surpass $160 billion by 2032, with retailers including
Walmart, Target and Amazon, joining fintech players like Block and PayPal in offering the
service to attract younger, credit-averse shoppers.
    With its quick approval process, easy access, and a revenue model based on fees, BNPL is an
attractive proposition for fintech while traditional banks have been constrained by stricter
regulations, higher risk assessment standards, and a reliance on interest-based credit products.

       NEW DELHI, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's <GOOGL.O>
Google is close to deciding on locations in its key market of
India where it will open its first physical retail stores
outside the United States, three sources familiar with the
matter said.
    Google counts India as a key growth market, where it has
committed to investing $10 billion. It currently has only five
physical stores, all in the United States, which sell its
products such as Pixel phones, watches and earbuds.
    It is aiming to mirror a retail approach that helped Apple
Inc <AAPL.O> rake in billions of dollars in the last two decades
by showcasing its own products. Apple has 500 plus stores
worldwide. 
        Google is in advanced stages of finalising locations in
or around the capital of New Delhi, and the financial capital
Mumbai, said three sources, who declined to be named as the
process is confidential. 
    Google declined to comment on the matter.
    The first source said the stores are likely to be around
15,000 square feet, and will take at least another six months to
open, though the timeline could change.
    The IT hub of Bengaluru in south India was also considered,
but New Delhi and Mumbai are the frontrunners, the person added.
    ""The idea is to compete with Apple ... especially to target
the luxury segment,"" said the person, adding more stores will be
considered if the initial ones do well.
    Google currently sells it products in India through
authorised retailers, as does Apple. But in 2023, Apple CEO Tim
Cook visited India to open its first company-run stores in
Mumbai, and then in New Delhi.
    Pixel phones in India cost from about $370 to $2,000 for
top-end models. Apple's iPhones cost from about $520-$2,130.
Google has also started making Pixel smartphones in India.
    In 2024, Apple dominated the local market for premium
phones, priced above $520, with a roughly 55% share, compared
with Pixel's 2% share, research group Counterpoint said. The
fast-growing Indian market has about 712 million smartphone
users currently.
    Google's plan to open the stores is firm and will be
executed soon, there are some standard regulatory and compliance
processes to clear before the stores can be set up, said the
second source, without elaborating on the issues.
        A third source said one of the possible locations Google
is considering near New Delhi is in the satellite city of
Gurugram, where many global corporations such as Uber and Meta
have offices and the likes of Uniqlo have retail outlets.
    In India, Google is battling many regulatory and legal
challenges. Among them are ongoing antitrust cases related to
its in-app billing system and abuse of market position in the
market for smart TVs.
    In a top-level departure, Google lost its India head of
public policy this month, marking the second departure in around
two years from the critical role which is key to government
engagement.

2025-02-20 06:00:00,RPT-EXPLAINER-Will Western companies return to Russia?,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250220:nL6N3PA0PA:2,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"(Repeats Wednesday's story with no changes to text )
    By Alexander Marrow
       LONDON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - As Moscow and Washington
discuss how to end the war in Ukraine, one of the many questions
on investors' minds is whether the corporate exodus from Russia
in opposition to the February 2022 invasion of its neighbour may
be reversed.
    As long as broad Western sanctions on Russia remain in
place, that looks unlikely, but should U.S. President Donald
Trump's administration seek to ease restrictions, it could open
the door for some companies to return to what was once a
high-growth market.
    Here is a rundown of the situation:
     
    WHO EXITED AND HOW?
More than a thousand companies from McDonald's <MCD.N> to
Mercedes-Benz <MBGn.DE> have left Russia in the last three years
by selling, handing the keys to existing managers or abandoning
assets. Others like Danone <DANO.PA> and Carlsberg <CARLb.CO>
had their assets seized and a sale forced through.
Western companies have acknowledged losses totalling $107
billion in writedowns and lost revenue, according to a Reuters
analysis in March 2024. Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian
Direct Investment Fund, says U.S. companies have lost $324
billion by leaving Russia. 
    Companies such as McDonald's, Renault <RENA.PA> and Henkel
<HNKG.DE> agreed buyback options when exiting. 
France's Renault sold its majority stake in Russian carmaker
Avtovaz in May 2022 for reportedly just one rouble, but with a
six-year option to buy it back. 
    Some food and healthcare companies, including Procter &
Gamble <PG.N>, PepsiCo <PEP.O> and Mondelez <MDLZ.O>, say they
stayed on humanitarian grounds to continue supplying Russians
with basic goods.
     
    WHICH SECTORS ARE LIKELY TO WANT TO RETURN FIRST?
After the highest-level U.S.-Russian meeting since the Ukraine
war began this week, Dmitriev said, without giving further
details, that he expects a number of U.S. companies to return as
early as the second quarter. 
    The most likely to return are those operating outside
sanctions, such as retailers and food producers, rather than
those in sectors such as energy and finance.
    Dmitriev said he believed U.S. oil majors that had been
successful in Russia would ""at some point"" return.
    Senior lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov this week said he thought
Visa <V.N> and Mastercard <MA.N> would soon restore payment
services. The two companies said their Russia suspensions
remained in place.      
         
    WHY WOULD COMPANIES NOT RETURN?
Hundreds of Western companies including Carlsberg and Unilever
issued statements condemning Russia's aggression against Ukraine
in the days and weeks after the invasion, framing their exit
from the country or suspension of operations in moral terms.
    Should a deal be reached that rewards Russia with Ukrainian
territory, companies that have criticised Moscow risk
reputational damage by returning.
            
    WHAT SECTORS ARE OFF LIMITS?
    Companies involved in supplying goods that have both
civilian and military applications are bound by Western
restrictions.
    Boeing <BA.N> and Airbus <AIR.PA>, for example, halted the
supply of planes and spare parts. Other examples include
semiconductors, telecoms equipment and electronics.   
Speculation is rife on whether the U.S.-Russia talks could yield
a softening of sanctions, but no concrete proposals have yet
been made. Meanwhile, the European Union on Wednesday agreed a
16th package of anti-Russia sanctions, including a ban on
primary aluminium imports. 
    Sanctions prohibit providing Russia with financial or
energy-related services and Russian officials' statements that
they expect Western companies to return look for now like
wishful thinking.       
        
    HOW HAS THE RUSSIAN MARKET CHANGED?
    Some of the world's most popular brands from Starbucks to
IKEA and Levi's have been replaced by Russian imitations.
The more than 800 McDonald's restaurants in Russia now operate
under the brand Vkusno & tochka (Tasty & that's it), owned by
Alexander Govor and run in a similar fashion.  
Starbucks <SBUX.O> sold its business to restaurateur Anton
Pinskiy and rapper Timati, and is now known as Stars Coffee.
Recapturing the market may be particularly hard for carmakers,
as Chinese competitors have established a more than 50% market
share, up from less than 10% three years ago.
It is not clear how willing Russia would be to support the
return of European carmakers at the expense of Chinese ones,
especially given the ""no limits partnership"" between Moscow and
Beijing as trade between the two nuclear powers ballooned. 
     
    WOULD WESTERN COMPANIES BE WELCOME?
Moscow has long promised to retaliate for what it views as the
theft of Russian assets abroad and has seized companies in
Russia through presidential decrees and the courts.     
Russia currently controls a handful of Western companies through
the guise of ""temporary management"" and is this year quickening
the pace of asset seizures of companies with foreign ownership
links. 
Most companies exiting Russia were forced to sell at huge
discounts. Convincing investors to dip their toes back into the
Russian market may take time.

 (New throughout, updates stock price, adds analyst comment)
    By Stephen Nellis and Akash Sriram
       Feb 19 (Reuters) - Apple <AAPL.O> launched on Wednesday
a budget-minded phone with artificial intelligence, the iPhone
16e, designed to win back mid-market customers at home and in
crucial growth markets China and India.
        The new phone, which drops the SE naming convention for
Apple's budget series, will take on popular Android smartphones
at a time when rivals Samsung <005930.KS> and China's Huawei are
adding AI tools to their devices. 
        Sales of Apple phones dropped last quarter, and sales of
its budget line of phones have plummeted as a proportion of
iPhone revenue over the last decade.
  
        The 16e will cost $599, a $170 boost from the previous
entry level phone, the SE, although its features are closer to
Apple's flagships and include a powerful chip to run Apple
Intelligence, a set of features with access to ChatGPT. Aside
from having no wide-angle camera lens, one missing button and a
slightly different display, the 16e looks much like its pricier
siblings.
  
        Apple stock was barely changed in midafternoon trade.
  
        Late last month, Apple forecast strong sales growth,
signaling iPhone sales would recover from a dip as it rolls out
artificial intelligence features to more regions and languages.
Analysts have cautioned that the roll-out is slow and Apple has
not yet announced a data partner in China for the AI features.
        ""We've seen a limited appetite among many of the
installed base to upgrade from previous versions, but the new
phone reduces the cost hurdle of joining the Apple Intelligence
bandwagon,"" said Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan
Chatterjee.
  
    Sales of SE model as a share of total revenue for iPhones
has dropped from 10% at its introduction in 2016 to about 1%
last year, according to Counterpoint Research.
    The 16e will likely help Apple in cost-sensitive markets
such as Europe and China where buyers tend to pay for phones
upfront, said Ben Bajarin, principal analyst at consulting firm
Creative Strategies.
    The iPhone 16e will be powered by the A18 chip used in more
expensive models launched in September 2024 and will support
Apple Intelligence out of the box.
    It will be about $200 less expensive than the cheapest
version of iPhone 16 launched in September and will be available
only in black and white colors, while the more expensive iPhone
16 models come in a slew of bright shades.
    The 16e will also be the first device from Apple to feature
the C1 chip, its first in-house modem designed for cellular
connectivity and a shift from chips made by Qualcomm <QCOM.O>.
     
    NO WIDE-ANGLE LENS
    Its camera system will have a 48-megapixel sensor and two
lenses, one of which will be a two times zoom lens integrated
into the primary camera, but it will miss out on a wide-angle
lens seen in more expensive models.
    The 16e will have a notch at the top of its screen for the
front-facing camera, while more advanced models have a screen
that surrounds the camera. 
        It also leaves out a camera control button that can
tweak camera settings and is available on the main iPhone 16
series.
  
        SE models were known for their smaller screen size, but
the 16e comes with a 6.1 inch display, the same as the least
expensive iPhone 16 model.
    This year's much-anticipated update brings a change to its
slab-design, nixing the SE's physical home button and
introducing Apple's Face ID feature.
    The iPhone 16e will be available for pre-order in 59
countries, including the U.S., China and India from February 21,
with shipments starting from February 28. 
    The SE model would be the last among iPhones to adopt the
USB Type-C port for charging, leaving behind Apple's proprietary
Lightning connector and letting it return to the European Union
market.
    Apple had discontinued the third-generation SE model and
iPhone 14 in the EU as the products did not conform with local
laws requiring USB Type-C charging standard.

in opposition to the February 2022 invasion of its neighbour may
be reversed.
    As long as broad Western sanctions on Russia remain in
place, that looks unlikely, but should U.S. President Donald
Trump's administration seek to ease restrictions, it could open
the door for some companies to return to what was once a
high-growth market.
    Here is a rundown of the situation:
     
    WHO EXITED AND HOW?
More than a thousand companies from McDonald's <MCD.N> to
Mercedes-Benz <MBGn.DE> have left Russia in the last three years
by selling, handing the keys to existing managers or abandoning
assets. Others like Danone <DANO.PA> and Carlsberg <CARLb.CO>
had their assets seized and a sale forced through.
Western companies have acknowledged losses totalling $107
billion in writedowns and lost revenue, according to a Reuters
analysis in March 2024. Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian
Direct Investment Fund, says U.S. companies have lost $324
billion by leaving Russia. 
    Companies such as McDonald's, Renault <RENA.PA> and Henkel
<HNKG.DE> agreed buyback options when exiting. 
France's Renault sold its majority stake in Russian carmaker
Avtovaz in May 2022 for reportedly just one rouble, but with a
six-year option to buy it back. 
    Some food and healthcare companies, including Procter &
Gamble <PG.N>, PepsiCo <PEP.O> and Mondelez <MDLZ.O>, say they
stayed on humanitarian grounds to continue supplying Russians
with basic goods.
     
    WHICH SECTORS ARE LIKELY TO WANT TO RETURN FIRST?
After the highest-level U.S.-Russian meeting since the Ukraine
war began this week, Dmitriev said, without giving further
details, that he expects a number of U.S. companies to return as
early as the second quarter. 
    The most likely to return are those operating outside
sanctions, such as retailers and food producers, rather than
those in sectors such as energy and finance.
    Dmitriev said he believed U.S. oil majors that had been
successful in Russia would ""at some point"" return.
    Senior lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov this week said he thought
Visa <V.N> and Mastercard <MA.N> would soon restore payment
services. The two companies said their Russia suspensions
remained in place.      
         
    WHY WOULD COMPANIES NOT RETURN?
Hundreds of Western companies including Carlsberg and Unilever
issued statements condemning Russia's aggression against Ukraine
in the days and weeks after the invasion, framing their exit
from the country or suspension of operations in moral terms.
    Should a deal be reached that rewards Russia with Ukrainian
territory, companies that have criticised Moscow risk
reputational damage by returning.
            
    WHAT SECTORS ARE OFF LIMITS?
    Companies involved in supplying goods that have both
civilian and military applications are bound by Western
restrictions.
    Boeing <BA.N> and Airbus <AIR.PA>, for example, halted the
supply of planes and spare parts. Other examples include
semiconductors, telecoms equipment and electronics.   
Speculation is rife on whether the U.S.-Russia talks could yield
a softening of sanctions, but no concrete proposals have yet
been made. Meanwhile, the European Union on Wednesday agreed a
16th package of anti-Russia sanctions, including a ban on
primary aluminium imports. 
    Sanctions prohibit providing Russia with financial or
energy-related services and Russian officials' statements that
they expect Western companies to return look for now like
wishful thinking.       
        
    HOW HAS THE RUSSIAN MARKET CHANGED?
    Some of the world's most popular brands from Starbucks to
IKEA and Levi's have been replaced by Russian imitations.
The more than 800 McDonald's restaurants in Russia now operate
under the brand Vkusno & tochka (Tasty & that's it), owned by
Alexander Govor and run in a similar fashion.  
Starbucks <SBUX.O> sold its business to restaurateur Anton
Pinskiy and rapper Timati, and is now known as Stars Coffee.
Recapturing the market may be particularly hard for carmakers,
as Chinese competitors have established a more than 50% market
share, up from less than 10% three years ago.
It is not clear how willing Russia would be to support the
return of European carmakers at the expense of Chinese ones,
especially given the ""no limits partnership"" between Moscow and
Beijing as trade between the two nuclear powers ballooned. 
     
    WOULD WESTERN COMPANIES BE WELCOME?
Moscow has long promised to retaliate for what it views as the
theft of Russian assets abroad and has seized companies in
Russia through presidential decrees and the courts.     
Russia currently controls a handful of Western companies through
the guise of ""temporary management"" and is this year quickening
the pace of asset seizures of companies with foreign ownership
links. 
Most companies exiting Russia were forced to sell at huge
discounts. Convincing investors to dip their toes back into the
Russian market may take time.

 (Adds Qualcomm and Apple share moves)
    By Stephen Nellis
       SUNNYVALE, California, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Apple <AAPL.O>
on Wednesday revealed its first custom-designed modem chip that
will help connect iPhones to wireless data networks, a move that
will make the company less reliant on chips from Qualcomm
<QCOM.O> that also power its Android rivals.
    The chip will be at the heart of Apple's $599 iPhone 16e
unveiled on Wednesday. Apple executives told Reuters these chips
will roll out across its products in the coming years but did
not give details on the timing.
    The chips are part of a new collection of components Apple
calls the C1 subsystem. A subsystem houses key components like
processors and memory. 
    The iPhone 16e, which will feature the same A18 processor
chip as the rest of its iPhone 16 lineup, has the best battery
life of any of its 6.1-inch phones thanks to the C1 system,
Apple's Kaiann Drance, vice president of iPhone product
marketing, told Reuters. The iPhone 16e will also have Apple's
latest artificial intelligence features, Drance said.  
    Modem chips are hard to make because they must be compatible
with hundreds of carriers in scores of countries. Only a handful
of companies around the world including Samsung Electronics
<005930.KS>, MediaTek <2454.TW> and Huawei Technologies
[HWT.UL], have successfully created one.
    For years, Apple sourced modems from Qualcomm, the world's
biggest supplier of the chips. Qualcomm chips also power Android
gadgets and Windows laptops that compete with Apple's devices.
    Apple fought a protracted legal battle with Qualcomm but
ultimately settled and signed new supply agreements with it in
2019 after alternative suppliers such as Intel <INTC.O> failed
to deliver a viable alternative.
    But Apple is now confident it has created an advanced chip
that will form the basis of a modem platform Apple will use for
years to come.
    
    NEW PLATFORM WITH GLOBAL COMPATIBILITY
    The C1 subsystem is the most complex technology Apple has
ever built, with a baseband modem manufactured with advanced
4-nanometer chipmaking technology and a transceiver made with
7-nanometer technology, Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice
president of hardware technologies, said in an interview at one
of Apple's silicon labs in Sunnyvale, California.
    The chips had to be tested with 180 carriers in 55 countries
to ensure they will work in all the places Apple ships iPhones.
    ""We build a platform for generations,"" Srouji said. ""C1 is
the start, and we're going to keep improving that technology
each generation, so that it becomes a platform for us that will
be used to truly differentiate this technology for our
products.""
    One of the ways Apple hopes the C1 will set its iPhones
apart is by tightly integrating it with its processor chips.
    For example, if an iPhone encounters congested data
networks, the phone's processor can signal to the modem which
traffic is the most time sensitive and put it ahead of other
data transfers, making the phone feel more responsive to the
user's needs, said Arun Mathias, vice president for wireless
software at Apple. 
    The C1 chips also have custom GPS systems and satellite
connectivity for when iPhone users are away from mobile data
networks. But they will lack some features, such as the ability
to connect to what are known as millimeter wave 5G networks.
    Millimeter-wave technology is one of Qualcomm's strongholds.
Apple executives declined to say when the company's chips will
have the technology or how quickly Apple will phase out
Qualcomm's chips.
    Qualcomm executives have told investors they expect their
share of Apple modems to drop from its current 100% to as low as
20% by next year, though Qualcomm still has a technology
licensing agreement in place with Apple until at least 2027.
    Qualcomm shares were up about 1% after Apple's announcement.
Apple shares were largely unchanged.
    Apple's Srouji said that the company's goal was not to match
the specifications of its chip rivals but instead to design
products specific to the needs of Apple products. 
    ""We're not the merchant vendor to go compete with Qualcomm
and MediaTek and others. I believe we're building something
truly differentiating that our customer will benefit from,"" he
said.

2025-02-19 16:00:50,CORRECTED-FACTBOX-All of Donald Trump's tariffs and threatened trade actions,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250219:nL2N3PA0B2:2,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"(Corrects paragraph 13 to change date of imposing tariffs on
Canada and Mexico to March 4 from March 1)
       Feb 19 (Reuters) - Since returning to office last month,
U.S. President Donald Trump has initiated numerous tariffs and
made even more frequent threats to impose levies on imported
goods. 
    They range from broad ones - a universal tariff on
foreign-imported goods - to ones aimed at specific sectors,
regions, or countries in an effort to get others to meet his
policy demands.
    Trump's threats have changed over time, leaving other
nations and businesses unclear of what is to come next.
    Here is a roundup of Trump's trade-related steps and
threats. 
     
    BROAD TARIFFS
        A cornerstone of Trump's vision includes a phased
rollout of universal tariffs on all U.S. imports.
    Last week, Trump tasked his economics team with devising
plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country that taxes U.S.
imports, and to counteract non-tariff barriers such as vehicle
safety rules that exclude U.S. autos and value-added taxes that
increase their cost.
    Whereas tariffs were once the mainstay of U.S. tax revenues,
in recent decades they have dwindled to a fraction of U.S. tax
receipts. Economists say Trump's policies will be inflationary
as importing businesses, which pay tariffs, will likely pass
added costs to consumers.
    Global trading partners could impose counter-tariffs,
targeting U.S. agricultural, energy, and machinery exports. This
could escalate into a worldwide trade war, creating uncertainty
for businesses and investors.
     
    SPECIFIC COUNTRIES
    Trump's tariff proposals target several key trade partners.
    
    MEXICO AND CANADA: The two countries were the largest trade
partners of the U.S. in 2024 through November, with Mexico
ranked first. Trump announced he was imposing 25% duties on
imports from Mexico and Canada to go into effect Feb. 4 as
retaliation for migration and fentanyl trafficking.
    Just before those tariffs were imposed, however, Trump
paused them until March 4, pending negotiations with those two
nations. 
     Canada primarily exports crude oil and other energy goods
along with cars and car parts as part of the North American auto
manufacturing chain. Mexico exports various goods to the U.S. in
the industrial and auto sectors.
    
    CHINA: Trump imposed a 10% tariff against China, keeping his
promise to put levies on those imports. China announced it would
retaliate with levies on some U.S. goods beginning on Monday. In
Trump's first term, the two countries engaged in a long trade
war that hurt both economies.    
    
    EUROPE: Trump said the EU and other countries have troubling
trade surpluses with the United States. He has said the
countries' products will either be subject to tariffs or he will
demand they buy more oil and gas from the U.S., even though U.S.
gas export capacity is near its limits.
        The European Commission said in a statement on February
14 that it viewed the ""reciprocal"" trade policy as a step in the
wrong direction.
    
    RUSSIA: Trump has threatened to hit Russia ""and other
participating countries"" with taxes, tariffs and sanctions if a
deal to end the war in Ukraine is not struck soon. 
    
    INDIA/BRICS NATIONS: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met
with Trump in Washington last week and offered to talk about
easing tariffs, buying more U.S. oil, gas and combat aircraft,
and potential concessions. 
        India imposes the highest tariffs on U.S. exports of any
major U.S. trading partner.
    Trump also threatened the broader BRICS group of nations
with tariffs if they did not commit to not create a new
currency. 
    
    COLOMBIA: Trump said he would put 25% tariffs on Colombian
goods after the country refused to take in flights carrying
migrants to be deported from the U.S.; the two sides worked out
an agreement.
     
    PRODUCTS
    METALS: Trump on Sunday said he was going to put tariffs on
imports of all steel and aluminum, used by automakers, aerospace
companies, and in construction and infrastructure. 
    The U.S. is the world's largest aluminum importer, according
to World Bank data. It has had a trade deficit in steel for a
decade, according to the International Trade Administration. It
is the second largest steel importer worldwide, with more than
half of those volumes coming from Canada, Mexico and Brazil.
    
    SEMICONDUCTORS: Trump said tariffs on semiconductor chips
would also start at ""25% or higher"", rising substantially over
the course of a year, but didn't clarify when these will come
into effect.
    Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co <2330.TW> the world's
largest contract chipmaker, makes semiconductors for Nvidia,
Apple and other U.S. clients, and generated 70% of its revenue
in 2024 from customers based in North America.
    
    PHARMACEUTICALS: Imposing 25% or higher tariffs on imported
pharmaceuticals could weigh on Japan, home of major drugmakers
such as Takeda, Astellas, Daiichi Sankyo and Eisai.
        India would also 
    be impacted
     as most domestic generic drugmakers count the U.S. as their
largest market, with exports to the country accounting for about
31% of the industry's overall exports.
  
    
    AUTOMOBILES: Trump said levies on automobiles would come as
soon as April 2. The European Union, for instance, collects a
10% duty on vehicle imports, four times the U.S. passenger car
tariff rate of 2.5%. However, the U.S. currently collects a 25%
tariff on pickup trucks from countries other than Mexico and
Canada. 
    Trump had also floated the idea of 100% or greater tariffs
on other vehicles, including potentially EVs. The automobile
industry accounted for imports of more than $202 billion from
Canada and Mexico combined in 2024.

2025-02-19 15:40:31,Apple and Epic Games head back to court over App Store order,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250219:nL2N3PA06J:6,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"By Mike Scarcella
       Feb 19 (Reuters) - Two Apple executives and three other
senior Apple employees are expected to testify in California
federal court next week, as a judge reconvenes a hearing into
claims that the iPhone maker violated her order to allow more
competition in its lucrative App Store.
    In an order on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez
Rogers in Oakland rejected Apple's bid to shield some employees
from testifying at the hearing, part of an antitrust lawsuit
lodged in 2020 by “Fortnite” maker Epic Games.
    Rogers ordered Apple in 2021 to give developers more power
to steer app users to payment options outside of Apple’s
ecosystem. Epic has accused Apple of breaching that order by
imposing an onerous commission on some transactions.
    The judge is weighing Epic’s effort to enforce her ruling
and to hold Apple in contempt. Apple has denied violating
Rogers’ order.
    Apple and Epic did not immediately respond to requests for
comment. 
    Two top Apple executives, Phil Schiller and Carson Oliver,
are expected to defend the company’s conduct at the hearing.
Three other employees including Marni Goldberg, director of
corporate communications at Apple, are also set to testify after
Rogers dismissed Apple's objections.
    The February 24 hearing is scheduled to last three days,
resuming a proceeding that began nearly a year ago over Apple’s
compliance with the App Store injunction.
    Rogers placed the hearing on hold last year to allow Epic to
request and review tens of thousands of documents from Apple
about its App Store commission policies and its compliance with
the court’s injunction.
    Apple recently told Epic there was no justification for
requiring new testimony from Apple employees who had not
appeared at last year’s hearing.
    Epic countered that it should be allowed to question key
employees who were part of the Apple team responsible for
implementing Rogers' order.
    The judge said in Tuesday’s order that it was “entirely
untenable that Apple would not expect Epic to call additional
witnesses.”
    
    The case is Epic Games v. Apple, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California, No. 4:20-cv-05640.

2025-02-19 11:56:14,Apple to launch new lower-cost iPhone to capture a broader market,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250219:nL3N3PA0Q4:7,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"Feb 19 (Reuters) - Apple <AAPL.O> is set to launch its
latest budget iPhone model on Wednesday as it looks to grab a
bigger share of the mid-range smartphone market and fend off
competition from rivals such Samsung <005930.KS> and China's
Huawei.
    The fourth generation of the lower-cost model, so far known
as iPhone SE, will take on popular Android smartphones at a time
when consumer electronics makers are looking to add artificial
intelligence tools into their devices.
    The current-generation of iPhone SE, released in 2022, is
available at $429 and the latest version is likely to be priced
at a premium to the outgoing model. The iPhone 16, launched in
September, starts at $799 for the base variant.
    ""If the SE 4 offers meaningful upgrades in design,
performance, and AI features, it could reinvigorate its market
appeal and strengthen Apple's position across different price
segments,"" Counterpoint Research senior analyst Varun Mishra
said.
     Apple late last month forecast strong sales growth
signaling that the company will recover from a dip in iPhone
sales as it rolls out artificial intelligence features in the
coming months to more regions and languages.
        However, analysts have been cautious about the sales
boost such tools could provide, as Apple's AI features are set
to be rolled out in phases in some regions on its latest iPhone
16 line-up and the iPhone 15 Pro model.
    The SE model's sales as part of total revenue for iPhones
has dropped from 10% from its introduction in 2016 to about 1%
last year, according to Counterpoint Research.
    This year's update is expected to revamp its slab-design,
ditch the physical home button and introduce its FaceID feature,
apart from camera and processor updates to support AI features,
according to analysts and media reports.
    The SE model would be the last among iPhones to adopt the
USB Type-C port for charging, a departure from its proprietary
Lightning connector.
    Apple has already discontinued the current SE and iPhone 14
in the European Union as the products do not conform with local
laws requiring USB Type-C charging standard. The latest SE model
would let it return to the EU.

investigation in the supply of mobile browsers and browser
engines and the distribution of cloud gaming services through
app stores on mobile devices in the country were published on
the government website on Wednesday.
    With respect to remedy options on providing feature access,
Apple said it would ""not be appropriate"" to mandate that access
to future WebKit or that iOS features in use by Safari be
provided free of charge, adding that developing features is a
time and resource-intensive process.

2025-02-18 19:44:50,UPDATE 1-Groups ask US court to reconsider ruling blocking net neutrality rules,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250218:nL2N3P90YK:2,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"(Adds no immediate FCC comment, more details, background in
paragraphs 4-11)
    By David Shepardson
       WASHINGTON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Public interest groups on
Tuesday asked the full 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to
reconsider a ruling that the Federal Communications Commission
lacked legal authority to reinstate landmark net neutrality
rules.
    The decision by a three-judge panel blocked the FCC under
then President Joe Biden that had sought to reinstate the open
internet rules implemented in 2015 but later repealed by the
agency under President Donald Trump.
    The groups -- Free Press, Public Knowledge, Open Technology
Institute and the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society --
argue the appeals court decision conflicts with an earlier
decision by another court.
    The groups said the case centers on the FCC's decades-long
effort to prevent broadband internet providers ""from abusing 
    their gatekeeping power, in furtherance of the providers’
economic or political interests, to constrain their users’
access to third-party websites.""
  
        A spokesperson for FCC Chair Brendan Carr, who voted
against net neutrality rules, did not immediately comment.
  
    Net-neutrality rules require internet service providers to
treat internet data and users equally rather than restricting
access, slowing speeds or blocking content for certain users.
The rules also forbid special arrangements in which ISPs give
improved network speeds or access to favored users.
    The decision leaves in place state neutrality rules adopted
by California and others but may end more than 20 years of
efforts to give federal regulators sweeping oversight over the
internet.
    The FCC voted in April along party lines to reassume
regulatory oversight of broadband internet and reinstate open
internet rules. Industry groups filed suit and successfully
convinced the court to temporarily block the rules as they
considered the case.
   The rules would have given the FCC new tools to crack down on
Chinese telecom companies and the ability to monitor internet
service outages.
    A group representing companies including Amazon.com
<AMZN.O>, Apple <AAPL.O>, Alphabet <GOOGL.O> and Meta Platforms
<META.O> had backed the FCC net-neutrality rules, while
USTelecom, an industry group whose members include AT&T <T.N>
and Verizon <VZ.N>, last year called reinstating net neutrality
""entirely counterproductive, unnecessary, and an anti-consumer
regulatory distraction.""

2025-02-18 10:00:30,"Taiwan electronics firms plan more Texas investments, industry body says",urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250218:nL3N3P90O5:2,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"By Wen-Yee Lee
       TAIPEI, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Taiwanese electronics
companies are planning more investments in the U.S. state of
Texas, with announcements possible in May to coincide with
President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, the head of
an industry body said on Tuesday.
    Trump, who took office on Jan. 20, has lambasted Taiwan for
taking U.S. semiconductor business, and has also threatened
import tariffs on trading partners with which the United States
runs large trade deficits, which could target Taiwan.
    Last week, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te pledged more
investment in the United States.
    Richard Lee, chairman of the Taiwan Electrical and
Electronic Manufacturers' Association, told an event in Taipei
that the government of Republican-led Texas has been proactive
about attracting investment from Taiwanese companies.
    ""We expect that this year, especially in the first 100 days
of Trump's presidency, that's about May 10, there should be a
much larger number of our large server companies, especially for
AI servers, announcing that they're going to be expanding their
investments in Texas,"" Lee said, without naming any companies.
    ""A lot of them have factories in Texas, but the factories in
the past weren't big enough to face the significant growth of
AI-related businesses in the future, so this is an opportunity,""
he added. 
    Taiwan's Foxconn <2317.TW>, the world's largest contract
electronics maker and a major supplier to Apple <AAPL.O> and
Nvidia <NVDA.O>, said in November one of its subsidiaries had
spent $33 million to acquire land and factory buildings in
Harris County, Texas.
    Taiwanese contract laptop makers Compal <2324.TW> and
Inventec <2356.TW> - which also makes AI servers - may expand
into the United States with Texas eyed as one of the top
locations, their executives said last month.
    Inventec declined to comment on whether it might make
announcements in May about Texas investments. Foxconn and Compal
did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

    By George Hay and Foo Yun Chee
       LONDON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The EU's competition chief
says U.S. President Donald Trump has upended the ""trustful
relationship"" between the United States and Europe, and that
Brussels should focus on providing the predictability and
stability that is lacking in Washington.
    Teresa Ribera, the second most powerful official at the
European Commission after President Ursula von der Leyen, told
Reuters that while Europe needs to negotiate with the White
House and hear its concerns on trade, it should not be pushed
into making changes to laws that have been approved by
lawmakers.
    ""We need to stick to our strengths and principles,"" she said
in an interview in London on Monday, criticising Trump's
transactional approach to politics.
    ""We need to be flexible but we cannot transact on human
rights nor are we going to transact on the unity of Europe, and
we are not going to transact on democracy and values."" 
    Trump and other members of his government have criticised
the European Union for having too many rules and characterised
fines imposed on U.S. tech companies by the EU as a form of
""taxation"".    
    Last week U.S. Vice President JD Vance said European Union
""commissars"" were suppressing free speech due to clauses in the
bloc's Digital Services Act that gives the EU powers in urgent
situations to temporarily restrict access to an online platform
or search engine.  
    ""If there is a problem, a point of concern, please explain
that. It is not like bullying - that you can expect to enter the
negotiating table. That doesn't make sense,"" Ribera said. 
    Ribera has the power to approve or veto multi-billion euro
mergers and also slap hefty fines on companies seeking to
bolster their market power by throttling smaller rivals. She
also oversees the EU's green agenda and is tasked with keeping
it on track to meet the bloc's 2030 climate goals. 
    Tensions are running high between Washington and Brussels
after Trump's decision to impose 25% tariffs on steel and
aluminium from March 12; reciprocal tariffs from April; and
separate tariffs on cars, pharmaceuticals and semiconductor
chips.    
    Ribera pointed to the lack of certainty and predictability
across the Atlantic compared with Europe, saying that was not
what business wanted in the long term.             
    ""They want an ecosystem and a legal framework that provides
certainty, stability and predictability and I wonder why we do
not hear this question being raised the other way round towards
Trump's administration. 
    ""I don't see any predictability, stability or affordability
in these announcements, this is a little bit shocking.""
    The EU Commission, which coordinates trade policy for the
27-nation bloc, said last week it would react ""firmly and
immediately"" against tariff increases threatened by Trump.
    European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic was due to travel
to Washington on Monday for meetings with U.S. counterparts.
    
    APPLE, META DECISIONS
    The White House's frequent threats of various shapes and
sizes have unsettled executives, investors and consumers,
leaving them unclear whether the latest salvos will come to
pass, or whether exemptions could be carved out for companies
that lobby Trump.
    Last week, Ford <F.N> CEO Jim Farley said Trump's trade
moves have so far added ""a lot of cost and a lot of chaos"" to
American business.
    Ribera said the EU is ready to issue decisions next month on
whether Apple <AAPL.O> and Meta Platforms <META.O> have complied
with landmark rules reining in their power.  
    Both companies have been in the EU's crosshairs since March
last year and could face hefty fines of up to 10% of their
global annual turnover if found to have breached the Digital
Markets Act.
    There had been speculation that Ribera could delay the
decisions following criticism from Trump and Meta Chief
Executive Mark Zuckerberg of recent EU regulations which Big
Tech says unfairly target them with hefty fines. 
    Asked whether she would issue decisions on the two companies
in March, Ribera said: ""Yes, next month.""
    ""There will be decisions along the lines that have been
discussed with the companies, developed and based on evidence,""
she said.
    The Commission is also investigating whether Elon Musk's
social media platform X has breached the bloc's rules against
illegal content. Ribera said Musk's role in the U.S.
administration will not be a factor in the EU's decision.
    ""It is not a question of who is the owner of the company
that could be in one of these processes,"" she said.
    Billionaire U.S. businessman Musk is one of Trump's closest
advisers and was the biggest donor to his 2024 election
campaign.

       HONG KONG, Feb 17 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Donald Trump
may make the illogical logical. Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing <2330.TW>, the world's largest contract chipmaker,
is considering taking a stake in Intel's <INTC.O> factories at
the behest of the U.S. president's administration, Bloomberg
reported on Friday, citing a source. A similar idea was ruled
out by TSMC's boss C.C. Wei in October but with Washington
concerned about the fate of the California-based company and
threatening tariffs on foreign rivals, it may be a small price
to pay for the $840 billion Asian giant to protect its most
important market.
    Any potential tie-up between the two chipmakers will be
messy. Intel designs and sells its own processors as well as
manufactures for other companies, making it both a customer and
competitor for TSMC. But the U.S. firm has fallen behind rivals
in both businesses. Despite receiving billions of dollars in
government support and financing from asset managers such as
Brookfield <BAM.TO>, Intel's future as a standalone company, let
alone as a leading-edge chipmaker, is uncertain. 
    One scenario is for Intel to split into two. Broadcom
<AVGO.O> has been eyeing a deal with the company's chip design
and marketing unit while TSMC has ""studied"" controlling some or
all of Intel's chip plants, the Wall Street Journal reported
over the weekend, citing sources. Alternatively, TSMC could take
a 20% stake in Intel's contract manufacturing business, as part
of a consortium including U.S. peers like Qualcomm <QCOM.O>,
local media in Taiwan say. Such an arrangement would ease any
concerns over handing control to a foreign entity. 
    Regardless of the structure, a transaction would represent a
reversal from TSMC's earlier stance. Combining foundries is
notoriously difficult and costly. Moreover, if TSMC takes over
Intel's foundry business, which is forecast to generate an
operating loss of $9 billion this year, per Visible Alpha, the
company will probably have to share valuable expertise and
know-how with a future competitor. 
        A large acquisition was not part of the Taiwanese
group's plan A to ramp up manufacturing in the United States,
where companies including Apple <AAPL.O> and Qualcomm made up
70% of its sales last year. TSMC is currently investing over $65
billion to develop three leading-edge factories in Arizona.
Progress looks promising: One plant is in production, while
construction of the other two are ahead of schedule. 
    Trump changes the calculus, though. He says Taiwan ""stole""
America's chipmaking industry. Last month, he threatened tariffs
of up to 100% on overseas semiconductors, spotlighting the $16
billion worth of chip imports from Taiwan last year. He also
criticises his predecessor's CHIPS Act, through which the
Taiwanese group was awarded $6.6 billion in funding, plus $5
billion in loans as well as investment tax credits. Analysts at
JPMorgan say an extension of this support is ""critical"" for
TSMC's investments - these credits are due to expire in 2026 and
equal to 25% of capital expenditure for the Arizona factories.
For Wei, a deal with Intel may be appealing after all.

    By Yimou Lee and Ben Blanchard
       TAIPEI, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Taiwan President Lai Ching-te
pledged on Friday to talk with the United States about President
Donald Trump's concerns over the chip industry and to increase
U.S. investment and buy more from the country, while also
spending more on defence.
    Trump spoke critically about Taiwan on Thursday, saying he
aimed to restore U.S. manufacturing of semiconductor chips and
repeating claims about Taiwan having taken away the industry he
wanted back in the United States.
    Speaking to reporters after holding a meeting of the
National Security Council at the presidential office, Lai said
that the global semiconductor supply chain is an ecosystem in
which the division of work among various countries is important.
    ""We of course are aware of President Trump's concerns,"" Lai
said. 
    ""Taiwan's government will communicate and discuss with the
semiconductor industry and come up with good strategies. Then we
will come up with good proposals and engage in further
discussions with the United States,"" he added.
    Democratic countries including the United States should come
together to build a global alliance for AI chips and a
""democratic supply chain"" for advanced chips, Lai said.
    ""While admittedly we have the advantage in semiconductors,
we also see it as Taiwan's responsibility to contribute to the
prosperity of the international community.""
    Taiwan is home to the world's largest contract chipmaker,
TSMC <2330.TW>, a major supplier to companies including Apple
<AAPL.O> and Nvidia <NVDA.O>, and a crucial part of the
developing AI industry.
    TSMC is investing $65 billion in new factories in the U.S.
state of Arizona, a project begun in 2020 under Trump's first
administration.
    TSMC's Taipei-listed shares closed down 2.8% on Friday,
underperforming the broader market <.TWII>, which ended off
1.1%.
    A senior Taiwan security official, speaking to reporters on
condition of anonymity in order to speak more freely, said if
TSMC judged it was feasible to increase its U.S. investment,
Taiwan's government would help in talks with the United States.
    TSMC declined to comment.
    The official added that communications between Taiwan and
U.S. economic, security and defence officials at present was
""quite good"" and ""strong support from the United States can be
felt"".
    
    US SUPPORT
    The United States, like most countries, has no formal
diplomatic ties with Chinese-claimed Taiwan, but is the
democratically governed island's most important international
backer and arms supplier.
    Trump cheered Taiwan last week after a joint U.S.-Japan
statement following Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's
visit to Washington called for ""maintaining peace and stability
across the Taiwan Strait"", and voiced support for ""Taiwan's
meaningful participation in international organisations.""
    But Taiwan also runs a large trade surplus with the United
States, which surged 83% last year, with the island's exports to
the U.S. hitting a record $111.4 billion, driven by demand for
high-tech products such as semiconductors.
    Lai said that the United States is Taiwan's largest foreign
investment destination and that Taiwan is the United States'
most reliable trade partner.
    Trump has also previously criticised Taiwan, which faces a
growing military threat from China, for not spending enough on
defence, a criticism he has made of many U.S. allies.
    ""Taiwan must demonstrate our determination to defend
ourselves,"" Lai said, adding his government is working to
propose a special budget this year to boost defence spending
from 2.5% of its GDP to 3%.
    His government is involved in a standoff with parliament,
where opposition parties hold a majority, over cuts to the
budget, including defence spending.
    ""Certainly, more and more friends and allies have expressed
concern to us, worried whether Taiwan's determination for its
self-defence has weakened,"" Lai said.

    By Jonathan Stempel
       Feb 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway
<BRKa.N> on Friday disclosed a new investment in alcoholic
beverages producer Constellation Brands <STZ.N>, and said it has
reduced its holdings in four banks, including Citigroup <C.N>
and Bank of America <BAC.N>.
        In a regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock
holdings as of December 31, Berkshire also disclosed it has
stopped selling shares of Apple <AAPL.O>, which remained its
largest common stock investment at $75.1 billion.
  
        The filing nonetheless suggests that Berkshire remains
concerned about valuations, after selling $133.2 billion of
stock--primarily 490 million Apple shares--between January and
September 2024, and letting its cash stake grow to $325.2
billion.
  
        Berkshire owned $1.24 billion of Constellation stock at
year end, after purchasing 5.62 million shares in the fourth
quarter.
  
        In after-hours trading, Constellation's share price rose
6.7%, reflecting what investors view as Buffett's seal of
approval regardless of whether the revered billionaire investor
personally did the buying.
  
        Constellation did not immediately respond to requests
for comment.
  
        Its beer brands include Corona and Modelo Especial,
which in 2023 surpassed Bud Light as the top-selling beer in the
United States, while its wine portfolio include Meiomi, Robert
Mondavi and Kim Crawford.
  
        Berkshire also owns a small stake in Diageo <DGE.L>,
whose brands include Guinness beer, Johnnie Walker Scotch and
Smirnoff vodka.
  
        To go with the alcohol, Berkshire also invests in
Domino's Pizza <DPZ.O>, and boosted its stake by 86% in the
quarter.
  
        In Friday's filing, Berkshire said it lowered its
Citigroup stake 74% to 14.6 million shares, and its Bank of
America stake, until recently its second-largest common stock
holding, 15% to 680.2 million shares.
  
        Berkshire has reduced its Bank of America stake by
one-third since July, when it owned 1.03 billion shares.
  
        It has also unwound a small portion of the 700 million
Bank of America shares it bought in 2017, when it redeemed $5
billion of preferred stock acquired six years earlier and used
proceeds to exercise warrants at $7.14 per share.
  
        Bank of America shares have since risen more than
sixfold.
  
        During the fourth quarter, Berkshire also reduced its
stakes in Capital One <COF.N> and Brazilian fintech lender Nu
Holdings <NU.N>.
  
        It exited one stock altogether, cosmetics store chain
Ulta Beauty <ULTA.O>, which it owned for less than a year.
  
        Friday's filing does not say which investments are
Buffett's and which are from Berkshire portfolio managers Todd
Combs and Ted Weschler, who typically handle smaller Berkshire
investments.
  
        Berkshire also owns dozens of companies including the
BNSF railroad and Geico car insurance, and its annual report
expected on February 22 will include its year-end financial
results.

2025-02-14 22:48:16,"UPDATE 2-Hedge fund Viking buys Boeing shares, adds more JPMorgan, filing shows",urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250214:nL1N3P511W:2,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"(Adds bets on Boeing by Discovery, Soros Fund in paragraph 4)
    By Carolina Mandl
       BANGALORE/NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - U.S.-based hedge
fund Viking Global built a $526 million-worth new position in
planemaker Boeing <BA.N> in the fourth quarter, with 2.9 million
shares, and roughly doubled bets on JPMorgan Chase, a regulatory
filing showed on Friday.
    Shares in Boeing are up 3.92% year to date, but are still
worth 30% less than its peak in December 2023. The plane maker
has been trying to revive production that was dented last year
by a strike, and an accident that raised concerns about the
safety of its jets.
    In January, Boeing's shares rallied after the company said
it was making progress to stabilize production, despite a $11.8
billion loss.
    Some other investors also placed bets that Boeing's share
price will rise. Soros Fund Management, the family office of
billionaire George Soros, increased its stake in the plane
maker, while macro hedge fund Discovery Capital Management
unveiled a new stake.
    The $45.3 billion equities long/short hedge fund showed a
new stake in carmaker General Motors, with 2.6 million shares
worth $137.4 million.
    
    
    FINANCIALS
    Andreas Halvorsen's hedge fund reinforced bets on
financials, increasing stakes in JPMorgan Chase <JPM.N>, Bank of
America <BAC.N> and Charles Schwab <SCHW.N>.
    JPMorgan's was Viking's biggest stake in dollar amount at
the end of December, worth $1.8 billion, the filing showed. The
fund roughly doubled its stake to 7.5 million shares.
    It also had over $1 billion in positions in Bank of America
and Schwab. 
    The fund's positions were revealed in quarterly securities
filings known as 13Fs. While backward-looking, these snapshots
show what funds owned on the last day of the quarter and are one
of the few ways hedge funds and other institutional investors
have to declare their positions. The filings do not indicate
exact timing of purchases or sales and may not reflect current
holdings.

    RALLY IN US STOCKS MAY BE BROADENING OUT - DATATREK
    The rally in U.S. stocks may finally be broadening out,
Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, writes in a
note Friday.
    While the benchmark S&P 500 <.SPX> is up about 4% for the
year to date, the seven technology-related megacap companies, or
the Magnificient 7, account for just 0.2 percentage points of
that increase, he says.
    Meta Platforms <META.O>, which is on track Friday for a 20th
straight session of gains and up about 26% for the year to date,
is the only big contributor in that group to the S&P 500's gains
so far in 2025, he writes.
    ""The other six names have collectively been a drag on the
S&P,"" he writes, referring to Nvidia <NVDA.O>, Apple <AAPL.O>,
Microsoft <MSFT.O>, Alphabet <GOOGL.O>, Amazon.com <AMZN.O> and
Tesla <TSLA.O>. Colas adds that a broadening out of the market
rally is a ""common sign of a mid-cycle market.""
    For most of the last two years, Nvidia and many of the other
megacap names have driven gains in the stock market in a rally
fueled by optimism over artificial intelligence.
    A surge in popularity in late January of Chinese AI model
DeepSeek had poured some cold water on that optimism.
    Here is a graphic showing the performance of the seven
largest stocks versus the rest of the S&P 500:

2025-02-14 18:07:25,"Bridgewater adds Tesla stake, reduces rest of 'Magnificent 7'",urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250214:nL1N3P50SX:1,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"By Carolina Mandl
       NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Hedge fund giant
Bridgewater Associates added shares of Tesla <TSLA.O> to its
portfolio in the fourth quarter, while it trimmed exposure to
the rest of the ""Magnificent Seven"" group of U.S. tech and
growth stocks, a regulatory filing showed. 
    The firm founded by investor Ray Dalio ended December with a
small stake in Elon Musk's electric carmaker, comprised of
153,589 shares and worth $62 million, according to the filing
late on Thursday.
    Shares of Tesla are down roughly 13% this year and down more
than 26% since their all-time closing high on December 17.
However, the stock remains up well over 30% since the November 5
presidential election, with the company seen as benefiting from
Musk's close association with President Donald Trump.
    The billionaire entrepreneur is heading the Department of
Government Efficiency, which is in charge of cutting waste from
federal agencies.
    Meanwhile, the macro hedge fund made sizeable cuts in the
rest of its Magnificent Seven stocks. It slashed its stake in
Apple <AAPL.O> by 40% to 617,203 shares, and reduced its
position in Amazon <AMZN.O> by almost 35%.
    Cuts in Nvidia <NVDA.O>, Microsoft <MSFT.O>, Meta <META.O>
and Alphabet <GOOGL.O> ranged between 17.3% and 26.4%. However,
those positions were still worth hundreds of millions of
dollars. 
    In a recent letter to investors, Bridgewater's co-chief
investment officer, Karen Karniol-Tambour, discussed the
concentration of investors in AI stocks, saying it ""creates
significant portfolio diversification challenges.""
    The fund positions were revealed in quarterly securities
filings known as 13Fs. While backward-looking, these snapshots
show what funds owned on the last day of the quarter and are one
of the few methods by which hedge funds and other institutional
investors declare their positions. The filings do not indicate
exact timing of purchases or sales and may not reflect current
holdings.
    The hedge fund did not immediately comment on the changes in
its portfolio.

2025-02-14 17:27:38,"UPDATE 3-Nvidia cuts stake in Arm Holdings, discloses position in China's WeRide",urn:newsml:reuters.com:20250214:nL4N3P512W:2,NS:RTRS,AAPL.O,"(Adds shares of Arm Holdings in paragraph 9)
    By Jaspreet Singh
       Feb 14 (Reuters) - Nvidia <NVDA.O> reduced its stake in
British chip firm Arm Holdings <ARM.O> by about 44% and exited
its holdings in Serve Robotics and SoundHound AI in the fourth
quarter, a regulatory filing showed on Friday.
    The artificial intelligence chip giant also reported a
position of 1.7 million shares in China's self-driving startup
WeRide Inc <WRD.O>, sending its shares up 94%.
    WeRide uses Nvidia's advanced graphics processors and AI
software to power its vehicles and had a market valuation of
$4.71 billion as of the last closing. Nvidia was an early
investor in WeRide.
    Investors closely monitor Nvidia's stake disclosures as they
can influence the stock prices of companies it invests in or
divests from while providing insights into the growth strategy
of the dominant artificial intelligence chip designer.
    ""There is no greater vote of confidence than Nvidia taking a
stake in your company,"" said Dennis Dick, trader at Triple D
Trading.
    Shares of Nebius Group <NBIS.O> rose 8% after Nvidia
reported 1.2 million shares in the AI cloud firm in the quarter
ended December 31.
    Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia cut its stake in Arm by
43.8% to 1.1 million shares, valuing its remaining stock at
about $181 million as of Thursday's close.
    ""While trimming its Arm Holdings position may raise some
eyebrows, the move into Nebius and WeRide aligns with its
long-term AI strategy,"" said Shiraz Ahmed, senior portfolio
manager and founder of Sartorial Wealth at Raymond James.
    Arm, whose shares were down 5%, supplies the crucial
intellectual property that firms such as Apple <AAPL.O> and
Nvidia license to create their chips.
    Last year, struggling chipmaker Intel <INTC.O> sold off its
entire stake in Arm during a restructuring.
    Nvidia also dissolved its holdings in Serve Robotics
<SERV.O>, known for its sidewalk delivery robots, and
Israel-based medtech company Nano-X Imaging Ltd <NNOX.O>,
sending their shares down 42% and 13%, respectively.
    Voice assistant maker SoundHound AI's <SOUN.O> shares fell
29%.

    By Shashwat Chauhan and Sukriti Gupta
       Feb 14 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were muted
on Friday, though set for firm weekly advances as Treasury
yields continued to decline a day after U.S. President Donald
Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariff plans but stopped short of
imposing new ones.
        Yields across government bonds slipped for a second
straight day after data showed U.S. 
    retail sales fell more than expected in January, dropping
0.9% last month after an upwardly revised 0.7% increase in
December.
        ""In terms of monetary policy, this data supports the
likelihood of a second rate cut in 2025,"" said Quasar Elizundia,
research strategist at Pepperstone. 
  
    The yield on the 10-year note <US10YT=RR> fell about 7 basis
points, last at 4.44%.
    Trump, meanwhile, tasked his economics team on Thursday with
devising plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country taxing
U.S. imports, though the directive stopped short of imposing
fresh tariffs. 
    Howard Lutnick, Trump's pick for commerce secretary, said
the administration would address each affected country one by
one and said studies on the issue would be completed by April 1.
    Imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, a
bigger-than-expected rise in January's consumer prices and
hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell added
to market volatility this week, with uncertainty likely to
persist.
    However, all three major indexes are set for robust weekly
gains, with the S&P 500 <.SPX> currently just shy of its record
high hit three weeks ago.
    Stocks also got a boost earlier this week after data showed
U.S. producer prices increased in January, while key elements in
the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, a
measure closely tracked by the Fed, were benign or lower.
    Traders are fully pricing in at least one 25-basis-point
interest rate cut by the end of the year, with an about 50%
chance of an additional such reduction, as per data complied by
LSEG.
    At 11:22 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI>
fell 103.18 points, or 0.23%, to 44,608.25, the S&P 500 <.SPX>
lost 0.01 points, or 0.00%, to 6,115.06 and the Nasdaq Composite
<.IXIC> gained 9.67 points, or 0.05%, to 19,955.32. 
    Seven of the 11 S&P 500 sectors traded higher, with energy
<.SPNY> leading gains, up 0.8%, tracking rising oil prices.
    
    
    Nvidia <NVDA.O> outpaced most megacap and growth stocks,
adding 1%, while Apple <AAPL.O> bounced 0.8% higher. 
    Airbnb <ABNB.O> jumped 14.4% after the vacation home rentals
company posted higher quarterly revenue.
    DaVita <DVA.N> dropped 13.5% after the dialysis firm
projected annual profit below estimates. Warren Buffett's
Berkshire Hathaway <BRKa.N> also sold some of its shares in the
company.
    Applied Materials <AMAT.O> shed 6.4% after the chipmaking
equipment maker forecast second-quarter revenue below estimates.
    U.S. markets will remain closed on Monday for the
Washington's Birthday holiday.
    Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.83-to-1 ratio
on the NYSE and by a 1.2-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. 
        The S&P 500 posted 35 new 52-week highs and six new
lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 112 new highs and 58
new lows.

       Feb 14 (Reuters) - 
    Wall Street's main indexes were set for a muted open on
Friday, as investors awaited more clarity on U.S. President
Donald Trump's reciprocal tariff plans after robust gains in the
last sessions, with all three benchmarks set for weekly gains.
    Trump tasked his economics team on Thursday with devising
plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country taxing U.S.

    Imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, a
bigger-than-expected rise in January's consumer prices and
hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell added
to market volatility this week, with uncertainty likely to

    However, all three major indexes are set for robust weekly
gains, with the S&P 500 <.SPX> currently sitting about 0.2% away
from its all-time highest level hit three weeks ago.
    The S&P 500 closed about 1% higher on Thursday, boosted by
gains in Nvidia <NVDA.O>, Apple <AAPL.O> and Tesla <TSLA.O>.
    Stocks also got a boost after data showed U.S. producer
prices increased in January, while key elements in the core

points, or 0.16%, S&P 500 E-minis <EScv1> were down 3 points, or
0.05%, and Nasdaq 100 E-minis <NQcv1> were down 7.25 points, or
0.03%.
  
    Meanwhile, U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in
January, dropping 0.9% last month after an upwardly revised 0.7%

        Yields across U.S. government bonds ticked lower after

4.47%.
  
    Comments from Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan would also be
awaited later in the day. 
    
    
    Fourth-quarter earnings are estimated to grow 15.2%,
compared to 11.6% growth projected at the start of the month,
according to data compiled by LSEG.
    Tesla outpaced most megacap and growth stocks in premarket
trading, adding 1.8% after hitting an 11-week low earlier this
week.
    Airbnb <ABNB.O> jumped 13.5% after the vacation home rentals
company posted higher quarterly revenue.
    DaVita <DVA.N> dropped 9.6% after the dialysis firm
projected annual profit below estimates. Warren Buffett's
Berkshire Hathaway <BRKa.N> also sold some of its shares in the
company. 
    Moderna <MRNA.O> fell 4.7% after the vaccine maker reported
a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss.
    U.S. markets will remain closed on Monday for the

       Feb 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures dipped on
Friday, as investors awaited more clarity on U.S. President
Donald Trump's reciprocal tariff plans following robust gains in
the last sessions, with all three benchmarks set for strong
weekly gains.
    Trump tasked his economics team on Thursday with devising
plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country taxing U.S.
imports, though the directive stopped short of imposing fresh
tariffs. 
    ""The reaction to the reciprocal tariffs overnight was muted
and suggests that investors have moved on, at least temporarily,
from trade until the next set of data surprises on inflation or
economic confidence,"" analysts at Societe Generale said in a
note.
    Howard Lutnick, Trump's pick for commerce secretary, said
the administration would address each affected country one by
one and said studies on the issue would be completed by April 1.
    Imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, a
bigger-than-expected rise in January's consumer prices and
hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell added
to market volatility this week, with uncertainty likely to
persist.
        However, all three major indexes are set for robust
weekly gains, with the S&P 500 <.SPX> currently sitting about
0.2% away from its all-time highest level hit three weeks ago.
  
    Wall Street's main indexes ended higher in the last session,
as gains in Nvidia <NVDA.O>, Apple <AAPL.O> and Tesla <TSLA.O>
boosted the S&P 500 more than 1% higher. 
    Stocks also got a boost after data showed U.S. producer
prices increased in January, while key elements in the core
Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, a measure closely
tracked by the U.S. Federal Reserve, were benign or lower.
    Traders are fully pricing in at least one 25-basis-point
interest rate cut by the end of the year, with an over 33%
chance of an additional such reduction, as per data complied by
LSEG.
        At 6:53 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis <1YMcv1> were down 138
points, or 0.31%, S&P 500 E-minis <EScv1> were down 13.5 points,
or 0.22%, and Nasdaq 100 E-minis <NQcv1> were down 68 points, or
0.31%.
  
    On Friday, the January retail sales figure - a crucial
metric in gauging the state of the consumer - will be released
at 8:30 a.m. ET. 
    Comments from Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan would also be
awaited later in the day. 
    
    
    Fourth-quarter earnings are estimated to grow 15.2%,
compared to 11.6% growth projected at the start of the month,
according to data compiled by LSEG.
    Tesla led gains amongst megacap and growth stocks in
premarket trading, adding 1.3% after hitting an 11-week low
earlier this week.
    Airbnb <ABNB.O> jumped 13.3% after the vacation home rentals
company posted higher quarterly revenue.
    DaVita <DVA.N> dropped 7.9% after the dialysis firm
projected annual profit below estimates. Warren Buffett's
Berkshire Hathaway <BRKa.N> also sold some of its shares in the
company. 
    Applied Materials <AMAT.O> shed 5.5% as the chipmaking
equipment maker forecast second-quarter revenue below estimates.
    Moderna <MRNA.O> fell 3.8% after the vaccine maker reported
a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss.

5,6)
       BEIJING, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Alibaba's <9988.HK>
announcement this week that it will partner with Apple <AAPL.O>
to support iPhones' artificial intelligence services offering in
China has again thrust the spotlight on the country's AI
industry on the heels of DeepSeek.
    Following are some of the prominent AI services and their
developers to watch in China.
    
    DOUBAO
    Developed by ByteDance, a latecomer to the large language
model (LLM) market, the namesake chatbot is the most popular
consumer AI app in China. 
    The company's latest LLM, Doubao-1.5-pro, was released in
January and outperforms ChatGPT's GPT-4 in some metrics. 
    ByteDance is among the leaders in developing cost-effective
LLMs, and its offering is the cheapest available in the market,
even more affordable than DeepSeek, according to a Barclays
report. 
    Doubao-1.5 was priced at only 3% to 4% of GPT-4's pricing.
    ByteDance's low-cost advantage is attributed to its use of
the ""mixture of experts"" (MoE) framework, which is common among
various AI models in China, including those of DeepSeek. 
            
    QWEN
        Developed by e-commerce giant Alibaba <9988.HK>, Qwen is
the company's flagship LLM and chatbot.
    It was released in March 2023 and has been rated among the
top-tier in global benchmarks. 
    In January, Alibaba released  Qwen 2.5-Max and claimed its
functionality surpassed that of highly-acclaimed DeepSeek-V3.
    A strong advocate of open AI development, Alibaba announced
in September that many of its AI models would be made
open-source. 
    
    ERNIE
    Chinese search giant Baidu <9888.HK> was among the first in
China to launch a ChatGPT equivalent, Ernie Bot. 
    Baidu claims its latest model, Ernie 4.0, matches the
capabilities of GPT-4.
    On February 14, Baidu announced a plan to make its
next-generation LLM, Ernie 4.5, open-source from June 30, a
major shift in strategy as competition heats up.
    
    HUNYUAN
    Tencent <0700.HK> released its flagship model Hunyuan in
September and launched its chatbot, Yuanbao, in May 2024. 
    The company's massive user base, acquired through its
popular consumer apps like WeChat, gives Tencent a significant
potential advantage in pushing out consumer applications in the
future.
    Tencent also offers open-source models and advocates for
open-source development. Another advantage of Hunyuan is its
focus on multi-modality, which includes text, image, and video
generation capabilities. 
    
    GLM
    Zhipu AI developed GLM and claims its latest LLM, GLM4,
outperforms GPT-4 in some metrics.
    Initially born out of a Tsinghua University laboratory,
Zhipu counts Alibaba, Tencent, and the state-owned fund
Zhongguancun Science City Innovation Development among its
backers.
    In January, the U.S. Commerce Department placed Zhipu on an
export control entity list.
    
    KIMI
    It was developed by Moonshot, which is backed by the likes
of Alibaba, Tencent, and Hongshan. 
    Its chatbot Kimi is known for its long-context processing
technology and the company claims the model supports two million
input tokens, or units of words, for each query.
    On January 20, just two days before DeepSeek released the R1
model, Moonshot unveiled its own reasoning model, Kimi 1.5. 
    
    MINIMAX
    Minimax is a pioneer among Chinese firms in researching the
MoE framework and it open-sourced its most advanced model,
MiniMax-01, in January.
    MiniMax was founded in December 2021, well before the AI
craze sparked by the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. It is backed by
Alibaba and other prominent investors, including Hongshan,
Gaorong Capital, and IDG. 
    In addition to LLMs, MiniMax has gained recognition for its
social consumer apps, such as Takie and Xingye. 
    
    01.AI
    Similar to DeepSeek, 01.AI has adopted an open-source
approach and pioneered the MoE framework. 
    The company claims that its models are trained with fewer
resources and have a cost-effective advantage, achieving the
lowest cost level of LLM inference in the industry, 1/40 less
than GPT-4's list price.
    Its founder Kai-Fu Lee, a former head of Google China, said
recently in a written interview with Reuters that 01.AI has
formed a joint partnership with Alibaba to create a lab focused
on continuing the development of LLM technologies.
    The company is backed by companies like Alibaba and
Sinovation Ventures. 
    
    BAICHUAN
    Baichuan was founded in April 2023 by a team of former
executives from the search engine Sogou, including founder and
CEO Wang Xiaochuan, who previously served as the CEO of Sogou. 
    The company gained recognition in June 2023 by becoming the
first in China to launch an open-source model.

    By Jiaxing Li
       HONG KONG, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Chinese tech stocks
resumed their bullish rally on Friday to register their best
winning streak in over two years, driven by DeepSeek's AI
breakthrough, which reignited investor interest in China's
technology capabilities.
    The Hang Seng Tech Index <.HSTECH> jumped 5.6% to a
three-year high at close, bringing the week's advance to 7.3%.
That made a fifth consecutive week of gains, the best winning
run since China's post-COVID trade reopening started in late
2022. 
    The rally gained more momentum during the afternoon trading
session after a Reuters report that Chinese President Xi Jinping
plans to chair a symposium attended by Jack Ma and other Chinese
business leaders to boost private sector sentiment.
    Alibaba <9988.HK> closed up 6.3% at a three-year high on
Friday. Its shares have surged 24% this week, the biggest gain
since its public debut in the city in 2019.
        Xiaomi <1810.HK> surged 7.3% to a record high on the
symposium news, while Tencent <700.HK> jumped 7.4%, its best
single-day gain in two years. 
  
    The Hang Seng Index tracking the broader market in Hong Kong
advanced 3.7% to near its October high.
    Mainland stocks also edged up, with the blue-chip CSI300
Index <.CSI300> and the Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> adding
0.9% and 0.4% respectively. 
    ""Global investors are starting to reassess China's
investibility within the tech and AI space, after an extended
period of limited attention, which could still lead to a
recovery of positioning with thorough fundamental research done
at the individual company level,"" Morgan Stanley strategists
including Laura Wang said in a note on Friday.  
    The launch of DeepSeek's high-performing and inexpensive
large language model has sparked a strong inflow into AI-related
stocks since the Lunar New Year, driving a revaluation in the
sector. 
    The Hang Seng Tech Index has surged more than 60% since the
September trough, while the benchmark Hang Seng Index has
advanced 12.7% this year to rank as the best performer in Asia's
major markets after years of lagging.  
    Hedge funds have been snapping up Hong Kong's tech shares
for the past two weeks, and some long-only investors, mainly
Asian funds, have also started to add positions to chase the
rally, according to Steven Leung, director of institutional
sales at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong.
        Short-term momentum could stay for a bit longer on
consistent news flow from DeepSeek, 
    Alibaba
     and 
    Baidu
     <9888.HK> with new AI applications, he said. 
  
    The fact that U.S. President Donald Trump did not impose
reciprocal tariffs immediately eased concerns of a global trade
war for now. 
    Around the region, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific
shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> was up 0.37%, hovering near
the two-month high it touched on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei
<.N225> fell 0.8% but was on track to eke out gains for the
week.
