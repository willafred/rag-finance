The data obtained was sourced from Refinitiv Workspace, and the code to extract the dataframes were all copied and pasted from its in-built CodeBook. News headlines were limited to top deals for digital finance, corporate finance, and overall news about the stock itself."

      "**Earnings:** Tesla's Earnings Rating is **Negative**, significantly lower than the industry average. The company has a history of missing consensus estimates, with recent analyst downgrades. While the consensus price target has increased notably, the company has reported more negative than positive earnings surprises in the past.\n",

The company's net margin and interest coverage have been consistently higher than the industry average, but its accruals ratio is the highest within its group. Notably, Tesla does not currently pay a dividend.\n",

The company's Price to Sales and Trailing P/E ratios are significantly below their 5-year averages, indicating a discount compared to historical values. However, Tesla trades at a premium to its industry peers based on Price to Sales.\n",

      "**Risk:** Tesla's Risk Rating is **Neutral**, indicating moderate risk (medium volatility). The company's shares have shown low correlation with the FTSE 100 index, providing diversification benefits. However, Tesla's shares have been more volatile than the market in the short term, with larger daily price fluctuations.\n",
