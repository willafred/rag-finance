The data obtained was sourced from Refinitiv Workspace, and the code to extract the dataframes were all copied and pasted from its in-built CodeBook. News headlines were limited to top deals for digital finance, corporate finance, and overall news about the stock itself."

    "\n",
    "To facilitate the separation of documents into distinct chunks, RecursiveTextSplitter function was utilised, with an overlap of 100 characters so as to ensure the preservation of context between chunks. Therefore, this enables better understanding of each chunk.\n",
