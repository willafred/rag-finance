    "# DSA4265 Assignment 2: RAG Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "With the large availability of news available today from different agencies alongside the sheer number of stocks to select from today, it is increasingly difficult for investors to spend time to look through all news articles and reports about the different companies and the performance of their stocks to decide which to buy to maximise their returns. Through the controversial opinions on the performance of stocks, investors tend to rely on analyst reports in terms of scores for established metrics such as Earnings and Sentiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the goal of this assignment is to generate a Retriever-Augmentation-Generation (RAG) model that extracts key information about the overall performance of the stock data based on the recent windows, and providing investment advice to prospective investors about the performance of the stocks. This makes it easier for investors to make an informed decision about the investment in the stocks that have been included in the RAG model."

      "Key Risks:\n",
      "\n",
      " High Correlation with S&P 500: AMZN's high correlation with the S&P 500 (cited in the report) means it offers limited diversification benefits. This implies that during market downturns, AMZN is likely to experience significant losses alongside the broader market.\n",
      " Volatility and Beta: AMZN has a higher beta than the S&P 500, indicating greater volatility. This means its stock price is more susceptible to fluctuations, potentially leading to larger losses during market corrections.\n",
      " High Valuation: AMZN's trailing and forward PE ratios are significantly higher than the market average (36.3 and 32.1 respectively). This suggests the stock is currently priced at a premium, making it vulnerable to a correction if the company fails to meet investor expectations.\n",
      " Declining Performance: The report notes a decline in AMZN's average score, attributed to a decrease in Price Momentum and Insider Trading component scores. Additionally, AMZN has experienced negative returns in the past month and three months, suggesting potential investor concerns about the company's performance.\n",
      " Mixed Analyst Sentiment: While the mean recommendation from analysts is a \"Buy,\" the distribution of recommendations is skewed towards \"Hold\" and \"Sell,\" indicating a mixed outlook among analysts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Potential Advantages:\n",

      "Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided information, investing in AMZN presents a high-risk, high-reward scenario. While the company has a strong track record and continues to generate significant revenue, its high valuation, declining performance, and high correlation with the broader market make it a volatile investment. \n",

      "Investors with a high risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon may consider investing in AMZN. However, it is crucial to carefully monitor the company's performance and be prepared for potential volatility. For investors seeking a more conservative approach, diversifying their portfolio with less volatile investments is recommended. \n",

    "\n",
    "Through the usage of 2 different types of evaluation methods, the quality of the responses produced by the RAG model was relatively similar across the parameters tested, and the answers produced have been shown to be able to provide logical advice, conduct comparative analyses between stocks and companies, and also appear not to have any hallucinations. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths of Model\n",
    "Firstly, from retrieving relevant documents using vector search to using LLMs such as ChatVertexAI, VertexAI facilitates the entire RAG process. This is extremely key for RAG, as this allows both efficient document retrieval and the ability to generate relevant, context-rich responses to be achieved. The advantages mentioned above is also something commendable about the model built.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, it also integrates well with Cloud Storage, thereby enabling smooth data pipeline management and faster training cycles for the models used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses of Model\n",
    "Given the strengths of using VertexAI, there also comes weaknesses of the system. By requiring frequent retrieval operations, RAG models built from Vertex AI can lead to high compute costs, particularly when dealing with large document collections and frequent queries. The cost of both vector search during the retrieval of documents and the generation of text responses can accumulate very quickly. Additionally, given that it will there will be large volumes of queries in subsequent work, the costs of using this service can be very high as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Future Work\n",
    "Firstly, as only texts were considered in the RAG model built in this assignment, multi-modal RAG models could be considered since these models will be able to take in images and process the images and graphs to provide a better view of the performance of the stocks. Therefore, this improves the answers from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, for future works, beyond merely providing an answer or advice to investors, this RAG model has the potential to be adapted to forecast risk factors into the financial sector through the incorporation of more diverse financial indicators. Hence, better predictions can be generated as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the measurement of performance of the RAG model can also be improved in terms of comparing the performance. Beyond simply generating and showing evidence, perhaps additional techniques such as the measurement of importance of particular phrases can be done so as to provide greater insight as to why the answer was provided by the RAG model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "All in all, this model shows great potential in providing advice to prospective investors about different stocks through the summarisation of the reports in point form, and also through the comparative analysis between stocks. It also does not produce hallucinations which may mislead investors. However, more can be done to enhance the model in the long term to help investors in greater ways such as the use of multi-modal RAG models, and adaptations to achieve other functions investors intend to see such as performance forecasts for the various stocks based on the recent analyst reports."
